# Poetry
- Read a lot of poems
- Start by free-writing as a prose poem or a thought dump and choose the form afterwards
- don't worry if other people will like it or understand it
- read it out loud, watch out of tangled or awkward wording
- take a break and let the ideas rest

## Poetry exercises
- free writing is good for everyone. Write random words or whatever
- write a poem that is a definition of a word
- take a poem you've already written, but use different line breaks
- to expand your vocab, use a synonym of the one word in each line
- write a poem where every line is a simile/metaphor
- write a poem from the pov/life of someone else (fictional, historical)
- write a poem that limits the pov to one sense (that isn't sight)
- make 3 lists, one adjectives, one concrete nouns (physical things), one for abstract nouns (things you cannot touch). With one page of these, make another page of mataphors, one word from each lise to create a metaphor.
