- Go to Blues, Rock, and others in later years.
- Look at Music Theory Online often.
- Find other people to play with.

### How to use the instrument
- Learn sheet music
- Learn how to use the piano correctly
### Harmony
-   Develop literacy in the fundamentals of contemporary music theory (note identification, intervals, chord spelling to the 13th, scale construction including (diatonic scales, modes, non-diatonic scales);
-   Recognize the basic chord progressions of contemporary popular music (major diatonic with chromatic embellishments, minor diatonic with chromatic embellishments, modal with chromatic embellishments) in written form;
-   Analyze the chord progressions of popular songs in a variety of styles by employing Roman numeral and graphical analysis;
-   Express harmonic functions as chord scales and notate them correctly;
-   Reduce a written musical arrangement to a lead sheet using standard chord symbols;
-   Realize harmony represented by standard chord symbols in written form through a variety of voice leading techniques (i.e. 4-way close, guide tone lines, spread voicings, hybrids, etc.);
-   Analyze the harmonic implications of a given melody;
-   Harmonize a given melody in a variety of popular styles; and
-   Compose an original melody and accompanying chord progressions in a variety of popular styles
### Tonal Harmony and Counterpoint Core (composing and arranging)
-   compose short works based on the formal, harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, contrapuntal, and textural practices of the baroque, classical, and romantic eras of European classical music;
-   analyze the harmony, melody, formal, and contrapuntal components of music from the common practice period;
-   understand and articulate connections between common practice period musical techniques and those of contemporary popular music and jazz; and
-   incorporate common practice period musical techniques into their own creative work.
### Arranging
- Develop a practical understanding of the concepts and techniques of writing for rhythm section with and without a lead-line instrument of voice in a variety of contemporary musical styles;
- Notate music both by hand and with notation software;
- Analyze scores;
- Develop high-level harmonic and voicing skills to produce arrangements;
- Explore the use and integration of MIDI technology and sequencing as they relate to rhythm section and lead-line writing;
- Incorporate combinations of acoustic, electronic, and MIDI instruments into music writing projects; and
- Synthesize various contemporary musical styles and the musical concepts that comprise them, including writing from the "bottom up" (groove-driven) and "top down" (working with a melody in a lead instrument or voice).
### Ear Training
- Translate music notation into sound and movement, learning to sing and conduct music from notation at sight, accurately and without the aid of an instrument (given only a reference pitch);
- Translate sounds into notation and musical symbols;
- Develop accurate inner hearing or musical imagination of pitches, rhythms, and sonorities;
- Express their inner hearing through vocal performance and conducting, and through dictation (notation of heard music);
- Integrate their music reading, inner hearing, vocal performance, and instrumental performance, connecting their pitch, rhythm, notation, vocal, instrumental, and movement skills in real time;
- Analyze musical patterns and relationships and connect them with sounds;
- Integrate their aural perception of musical relationships, their ability to perform (vocally, rhythmically, and instrumentally), and their knowledge of music theory;
- Integrate their ear training skills with expressive performance and creative music-making, including improvisation and composition; and
- Evaluate their own processes for learning and practice, and learn to self-diagnose and prescribe solutions, for a lifetime of increasing skill and understanding of musicianship.
