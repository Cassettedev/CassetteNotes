# Becoming a Linux-Power User

## What is a Linux-Power User?
A linux poweruser is a Linux user that uses Linux to its fullest extent. Everything is customised and bespoke, tailored to the users use case. They will often use terminal based applications as opposed to graphical interfaces. Things like VIM or EMACS for text editing and i3wm or DWM as a window manager. 

It should be noted that the goal is to become relatively proficient with most, if not all of the things mentioned in this list, even if I do not use them for an extended period of time.

## Escaping the bot-net/modern web/shitter-net

### OS
- Linux or BSD of some kind

### Browser
- The more features you want, the more bloated and shitty the web becomes.
- Lynx or W3m are terminal based web browsers. No video on both and limited images on W3m. No javascript or addons.
- Surf is the suckless browser. Images, some video, javascript, no addons.
- Nyxt is a lisp-based browser. Images, no youtube, no javascript, no addons but fuly customisable with Lisp.
- Pale Moon. Ok, but slowly fading out of existence.
- Firefox is my current driver. I do not bother with any forks because they are all basically the same.
- TOR, not too knowladgeable about it. Will have to research further.

### Search engine
- Writing down URLs on a peice of paper and copying them directly is unironically a good move. Or bookmarks if you want to be normal
- SEARx is instance based, and probably one of the best options in terms of privacy. Results vary and are often limited though.
- Ecosia. Plants tress, probably, which is cool. Not great privacy though
- duckduckgo. Eh, not great not terrible. Might be the best compromise
- Brave. Might be better than duckduckgo
- Google. Bad and horrible. avoid

### Social media and internet socialisation
- Gemini protocol with terminal based browser is a good, even great idea.
- IRC chat is also a great idea
- Federated social media sites such as Mastodon, Peertube, and others are good.
- Matrix for messaging??? Must checkout more
- 

### Data storage
- Setup own cloud/homeserver

### DRM
- Use itch.io for steam
- Download your own music and movies on a local machine/cloud
- Post your art on a place/in a way that allows you to have complete, *complete*, ownership over your art.

### Bottom line
It is best to practice digital minimalism, to use the internet and technology as little as possible.
- Try to stay signed out of accounts as much as possible
- Use analouge media as much as possible. Notebooks, typewriters, offline apps, real-world entertainment, ETC.
