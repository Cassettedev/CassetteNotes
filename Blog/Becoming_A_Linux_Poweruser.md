# Becoming a Linux-Power User

## What is a Linux-Power User?
A linux poweruser is a Linux user that uses Linux to its fullest extent. Everything is customised and bespoke, tailored to the users use case. They will often use terminal based applications as opposed to graphical interfaces. Things like VIM or EMACS for text editing and i3wm or DWM as a window manager. 

It should be noted that the goal is to become relatively proficient with most, if not all of the things mentioned in this list, even if I do not use them for an extended period of time.
