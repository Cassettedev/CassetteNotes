# Goals
While I try not to live in the future to often, It is important to have something to be pushing towards. All of these goals do not have deadlines and do not have a stage of completion. They are things I can constantly improve and push towards.

#### Learn a language or twenty
It would be nice to be able to communicate with more people, not having language as a limiting factor. I have also read translations of books and poems and, while I enjoyed them, I can tell that reading them in their native languages would improve the experience tenfold.

Some languages might be;
* Russian
* Arabic
* French
* German

#### Improve at art, pick up new art mediums

I have appreciation for almost all mediums of art, some mediums I like are:
* Traditional drawing/sketching
* Acrylic/Oil Painting
* Digital art
* Photography

Ultimately, my goal in pursuing art is to;

* Create things for other people to enjoy
* Create things that make people think, challenge people
* Create things I've always wanted to create, and anything I might wish to create in the future

#### Become a competent writer
Similar to the previous goal, though separated due to hoe different writing is from other forms of art. 

Some forms of writing include:
* Creative fiction
* Poetry
* Academic writing
* Screen writing

Some thins I want to do with my writing:
* Create my own stories
* Create writing that has a political impact
* Be a "poetic" person, develop a unique prose

#### Become a competent musician
Again, similar to the previous, though separated due to how different music is from other art forms.

Some specifics:
* Learning many instruments such as guitar, piano, bass, drums, and countless others
* Learn to sing
* Learn music theory and sheet music, along with delving into other cultures/forms of music theory. Micro-tonality looks particularly cool.

#### Become good at Math, Programming, and STEM in general.
I seek to become a gay that can do math, making me the most powerful gay of them all.

Some specifics:
* Programming in many languages, from Python to Assembly, and probably down do things like logic gates
* Areas of math like calculus and linear algebra
* Basics physics
* Basic chemistry
* Engineering such as mechanical and electrical engineering

I seek to apply these things in areas throughout my life, such as:
* Using programming to create sustainable, bespoke software that I actually use.
* Using engineering skills for a similar reason, to create sustainable, bespoke tools I actually use.
* Using math, physics, chemistry, and engineering to have a better understanding of the world around me.
