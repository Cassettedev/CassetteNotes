[[Story Ideas]]

Merveilles is a collective of artists and engineers who strive to make themselves and the world a better place through the use of play and constant exploration.


### Visual
Merveilles has Euro-Asian influences in terms of aesthetics, keeping conscious effort to avoid colonization and other symptoms of white-supremacy that come with idolising anything Euro-centric. 

Merveilles carries strong, repeated motifs in fashion, industrial design, and user interfaces that are slick, minimalist, and concerned with values like cost, durability, maintenance, power consumption, and efficiency.

Colours are restricted to black and white with at most a single accent colour (usually a sea-foam aqua). Pixel art and vector art are prioritized. Industrial design is minimalist in nature, using geometric shapes, black metals, natural wood, plants, and cares-for antique tools among utilitarian objects and ad hoc electronics.

All forms of art are loved and appreciated, but art in-line with the Merveilles aesthetic is minimalist and somewhat abstract, inspired by sci-fi interfaces and Apple products, as much as it pains me to say that. Although the styles of 70s-90s anime is also appreciated, as well as "realistic" paintings of the 19th century. Photography in cinematography favors physical film rolls, or other "analogue" formats. Colours are deep and muted, focusing on earth tones again. High contrast with low highlights and deep blacks is common. Film grain or other imperfections are often added. 

Hardware, tools, architecture, and other physical objects follow design cues of brutalism, industrial design, and the modern minimalist trend. Devices that use only what's needed to convey information are praised and admired. Straight lines or consistent curves in abstract geometric patterns are favored. If not this, then vintage tools are loved, if not more-so than the minimalist tools. Old thinkpads and antique knives come to mind.

>No, I don't hate color, on the contrary, I respect color so much as to not apply it frivolously

Command-line environments and interfaces are as close to the core of Merveilles as you can get. Monospace fonts are common and kept visually simple.

### Audio
Merveilles primarily focuses on synthesized music, modular synths in particular. Acoustic instruments are also loved, having a focus on slightly more obscure instruments such as the hand-pan. Live-coding music with tools like ORCA is common practice.

When listening to music, listening to synthesized/electronic music is still common, though genres like punk and metal still appear.

Specific genres are quite niche, with genres like Dungeon Synth blurring the lines between electronic music and doom metal.

### Research/Abstract
Merveilles takes cues from things like hacker culture, Solarpunk, anarchism, and minimalism in terms of both aesthetics and philosophy. It has a large focus on the enjoyment of life, and believes life deserves to be enjoyed, and you should maximise the amount of time you spend doing what you love and minimise doing what you hate. 

>Merveilles is distinct from intersecting hacker culture in that it asserts that quality of life is tied to an aesthetic enjoyment of it

Notions of productivity are certainly prevalent, but they are redirected to be used for personal productivity, as opposed to optimizing productivity for the sake of a company, shareholder, manager, or any other external forces.

The Euro-Asian influence insists a focus on community, with art, science, and philosophy as a common bond. Cooking is also promoted as both a way to take control over your nutrition, and as a way to bond with other people.

Merveilles members often take the time to make art, software, worlds, languages, time systems, and many other things that bosses and managers deem useless. 
Some of these things are:
- Lietal, a small language
- Arvelie, an alphabetic date format
- Neralie, a decimal time format
- Neauismetica, a fictional world that serves to guide the aesthetics of art, music, and games.

If not making them, time is often spent learning "useless" languages such as TokiPona,"useless" art mediums, and making "useless" programs.

The ideology of Free and Open Source Software weaves its way through Merveilles, believing strongly in a message it sends and the culture around tech it promotes.

"Bloated" and inefficient programs are discarded in favour of low-power, lightweight programs that have similar functionality. If you cannot find a program that fits those requirements, writing your own programs is strongly encouraged. This DIY spirit goes beyond software and crosses over into the physical world, encouraging people to build their own instruments and tools, grow their own food, and find ways to be more self-reliant and sustainable. Programming tools made to run on 20-30 year old hardware is very common, and these tools are often bespoke, made to serve individuals and their use cases as opposed to being commercialized and trying to appeal to a broad range of people.

Sustainability plays a large part in guide the philosophy and ethics of Merveilles. Members are encouraged to think about how their actions affect the environment, with a focus of technology, power-usage, and E-waste. Users should try to make-do with whatever technology they have before going off to purchase a new device. If a new device must be purchased, buying low-power, second hand devices is encouraged. 

Merveilles and its members often hold strong leftist political beliefs, but actively resent Tankies and neo-liberals. Anarchism and Socialism are often mentioned. Theory is encouraged, but people are not insulted or persecuted for not reading theory.

## Recreation

### Visual
The Visual aesthetic of Merveilles is extremely flexible, allowing itself to flow into almost all visual mediums from fashion to UI design.

In terms of fashion, it is kept minimal in the sense that few clothing items are used, and they are kept visually "tame", adhering to the black and white colour palette. While many might see this as boring, the advantage of this is that your wardrobe becomes extremely flexible. You don't have to worry about making sure pieces match eachother, as there's a very high chance they just will. While all black outfits are considered "boring", there's a novelty of having a wardrobe that's 90% black. 

Accessories can also be used to elevate an outfit if needed. If I must wear Colours other than black or white, Sea-Foam green is a nice colour to go for. Earth tones like brown or dark green are ok as well. It is better to have few high quality pieces than many low quality ones.
From top to bottom, some specific pieces for my style might be;

- Combat boots, canvas shoes
- Cargo pants, jeans, high-waisted
- Tank-top, mesh shirts, casual sports bras
- Jumpsuit jackets, techwear jackets, chunky sweaters
- Beanies and baseball caps
- Round or Aviator sunglasses
- Minimalist earrings and necklaces

I also want to get tattoos. Black-out tattoos have caught my eye recently.

I already have a love for the art of the 18th-19th century, such as the works of John Singer Sargent, and I have always naturally enjoyed art with minimalist colour palettes. In terms of the art I make myself, I am still working on finding my own style, though I doubt that Merveilles won't have an influence. 

Hardware, tools, architecture, and other physical objects follow design cues of brutalism, industrial design, and the modern minimalist trend. Devices that use only what's needed to convey information are praised and admired. Straight lines or consistent curves in abstract geometric patterns are favored. If not this, then vintage tools are loved, if not more-so than the minimalist tools. Old thinkpads and antique knives come to mind.

I have always disliked "noisy" designs. I much prefer Windows95 and MacOS 7 over Windows Vista and MacOS Tiger. Like fashion, allowing individual things allows the collective appearance of them to be more coherent and pleasing on the eye. Letting individual pieces of hardware be "boring" also allows for deep and unique customisation, think draping plants over brutalist architecture, or covering your laptop in stickers.

### Audio
Through interacting with the Merveilles community, I have developed a love for genres such as Ambient, Dungeon Synth, Stoner Metal, and Shoegaze. I wish I could explain how I feel these genres relate to the aesthetic, but this remains to be difficult. Maybe it's the "dark", but not evil, aura of these songs. They are contemplative and "introverted" in nature, encouraging relaxation and self-reflection.
