# A collection of ideas for stories that I might create one day
### Jazz Superman
If The Batman is a grungy batman movie, Jazz Superman (name subject to change) is a fun superman movie. Jazz soundtrack, with the visual style of old 50s paintings matching the time that Superman was invented. Think Incredibles. Probably a comic

### Space earth repair thing
Inspired by that one remix of the Interstellar theme with the anime backing and sample that ISNT ON YOUTBE ANYMORE, this is a story about some astronauts in space fixing some craft in a mass scale effort to repair the planet from (??????). Solarpunk-ish. Probably a short story/comic

### Better RWBY
A story about a group of people; Weiss (transgener), Naive Ruby, Soft bot Jaune, Strong girl who dies Pyrrha, Quiet communist Blake, Strong Girls Yang. The story has themes of freedom, autonomy, abuse, and self discovery.

### Femboy brain molko story

### Gay drug dealer mafia story
Story about 2 dudes who are gay and one is a maker of a rare drug. Other mafias try to take down his empire and find where he makes the drugs

### Sci-Fi fantasy faster than light travel
A person travels away from the earth at a speed faster than light to observe the earth/an event in the past
