# World Building Vlogs
A series of vlogs explaining the details of my con-world.

## Episode 1
A basic overveiw of the world. Its purpose in my life, the overveiw of its genre, and what I want it to be.

### Intro
This world, I haven't decided on its name yet, is a con-world. Meaning, constructed world. Basically another word for standard "world builder" worlds. It's different from other worlds, in that it's designed to be more abstract and fluid to fit a lot of situations. I plan to use it in stories, DnD sessions, and many more, which I will describe. 

### Para 1
It's abstract in the sense that it's not as well documented and discards "pointless" details. For example, I won't be creating any maps of cities, and redudant details about any characters won't be documented. Instead, there is a focus on the design and "feel" of the world. It's almost like "vibes based world-builidng", as opposed to the "academic-type" world-building that many are used to, with heavy documentation and extensive research done in regards to how the world functions.

### Para 2
Why am I world-builidng like this? I am inspired by Devine and Rekka from Hundred Rabbits. Their worlds, from my perspective, are more abstract in the way I describe. You can find maps of broad areas and some character docs, but I get the impression that their worlds are purposefully abstract, almost surreal. I find this type of world-building enchanting and a breath of fresh air in comparison to the extensive, academic world-building that I talked about.

### Para 3
Devine and Rekka do something cool with their worlds. They take the aesthetics of their worlds, the vibe, and inject that vibe into their other works and even their personal lives, things that have nothing to do with their world. Devine's world is black and white with red and turquoise accent colours. This colour palette can be seen everywhere in their works, their software, and even their fashion sense. I find this really cool, and want to replicate it. I'm aware that this is an organic process, I can't force this level of integration. But that's part of the fun.

### Para 4
I know I've talked about the world being "abstract", but don't take that to mean "less detailed". Devine has also made an entire con-lang, a constructed language, for their world. And that is certainly detailed. The thing that makes it abstract is the lack of concrete information about the actual world. Like I said, I will not bother naming inns or explaining the plumbing system of a city. The purpose of this world is to serve as a vessel for my other creative pursuits. So, if an inn or a plumbing system somehow becomes relative to another creative pursuit, then I will bother to develop a plumbing system and into my world. Simple as that.

### Conclusion
So what was the point of this video? Well, I was supposed to explain some overall details of my world. But to be honest, I don't have any of those yet. The "genre" of the world is going to be sci-fan, science fantasy, and it spans across several thousand years from a classical fantasy era to a futuristic interstellar space age, with ups and downs of utopias and dystopias. That, along of the foundations of what I believe to be an interesting magic system, and the basic audio/visual aesthetics, is all I have right now. I will explain more about the actual world in the next video once I have more details about it. Check out my Ko-Fi if you want and uuuuuuhhhhhhh bye.
