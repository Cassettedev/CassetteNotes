# World Building Vlogs
A series of vlogs explaining the details of my con-world.

## Episode 1
A basic overveiw of the world. Its purpose in my life, the overveiw of its genre, and what I want it to be.

### Intro
This world, which name I have not deicided yet, is a con-world. It's different from other worlds in that it's designed to be more abstract and fluid to fit my needs.

### Para 1
It is absract in the sense that it is not as well documented and specific in many details. I will not be creating any maps of cities, for example, and only characters that have a significant influence on the story, or stories, will be documented at all. Instead, there is a foucs on the design and "feel" of the world. I can almost describe it as "vibes based world-builidng", as opposed to the "academic-type" world-building that many are used to, with heavy documentation.

### Para 2
Why am I world-builidng like this? I am inspired by Devine Lu Vinvega and Rekka of Hundred Rabbits. Their worlds, from my perception, are more abstract in the way I describe. You can find maps of broad areas and some character docs, but I get the impression that there is things about the world that are pursposfully "surreal" and abstract. I find this type of world-building enchanting and a breath of fresh air in comparison to the extensive, deep world-building that is often seen.

### Para 3
Extending on from that, Devine and Rekka also do something cool with their worlds, from what I gather. They take the aesthetics of their worlds, and injest them into their other works and even their personal lives, things that have nothing to do with the world. Devine's world is monochromatic with red and turqoise, and this colour pallette can be seen everywhere in Devines works, their software, and  even their fashion sense. I also find this really cool, and want to replicate it. I'm aware that this is an organic process, I can't force this level of integration. But that's part of the fun.

### Para 4
I know I've talked about the world being "abstract", but don't mistake that for being "less detailed". Devine has also made an entire con-lang, constructed language, for their world. And that is certainly detailed. The thing that makes it abstract is the lack of concrete information about the actual world. I will not bother naming inns or explaining the plumbing system of a city. The purpose of this world, is to serve as a vessel for my other creative pursuits. So if an inn or a plumbing system somehow becomes relative to another creative pursuit, then I will bother to incorporate a plumbing system into my world!

### Conclusion
So what was the point of this video? Well I was supposed to explain some of the overall details of my world. But to be honest, I don't have any of those yet. The "genre" of the world is going to be sci-fan, science fantasy, and it spans across several thousand years from a classical fantasy era to a futuristic interstellar space age. Along of the foundations of an interesting magic system and a basic visual/audio design. I will explain more about the actual world in the next video once I have more details about it. uuuuuuhhhhhhh bye.
