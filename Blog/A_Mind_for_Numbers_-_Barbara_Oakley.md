# A Mind for Numbers - Barbara Oakley
#booknotes
### Foreword:
* Henri Poincare struggled to figure out a mathematical problem for weeks. He figured it out when he took a vacation and let his mind rest.
* Your brain can work on a problem even if it is sleeping, as long as you think about it as you fall asleep.

### Preface:
* Repeated learning is a method of learning in which you simply read through notes or books over and over. This method of learning is not a good way to truly learn a subject. You simply become familiar with the text, but do not learn anything from it.

### Note to the reader:
* Professional scientists often figure out their own methods of learning and problem solving without sharing them to the general public. This books shares as much of this information as the author knows.

### Chapter 1:
* Many view themselves as being either "Good at math", or "Bad at math". The truth is that there are different "modes" for learning, and most do not tap into the one that makes them "Good at math".
* It is mostly the fault of the western education system. If you miss or blunder at any step of the learning process, you fall behind quickly. {page 2}
	>Mathematics - can be a saintly mother of a subject. It climbs logically and majestically from addition through subtraction, multiplication and division. Then it sweeps up towards the heavens of mathematical beauty. But math can also be a wicked step-mother. She is utterly unforgiving if you happen to miss any step of the logical sequence -- and missing a step is easy to do. - A Mind for Numbers - Barbara Oakley, {page 2}

	>I'd followed my inner passions without also being open to developing new ones - A Mind for Numbers - Barbara Oakley, {page 2}
* As Barbara progressed, she learned several things
	1. When and how to quit
	2. Don't take on too much at once
	3. Learn concepts and techniques related to solving problems
	4. Learn how to learn, learn how to learn the subject
{page 6}
* The brains purpose is to do calculations and work with data all the time, and it does it very efficiently. {page 6-7}
	>The Brain is designed to do extraordinary math calculations. - A Mind for Numbers - Barbara Oakley, {page 6-7}

#### Chapter 1: Summery
Chapter one serves as an intro to the author. She talks about her experience and trauma around math and scientific subjects., as well as and overview of how she came to learn math, and learn how the brain works. Learn how to learn. she then explains that she has talked to many scientists to compile as much knowledge as possible about this topic.

### Chapter 2:
* {page 9-10} A Chess player Magus Carlson took a few moments to walk away from a round of speed chess. This is an example of "diffuse" thinking in action.
* {page 10} Taking a bit to think and coming back to read this book is one of the core ideas of this book.
* {page 11} Mental pump. When reading a book, take a moment to glance over the chapter you are about to read. This makes several small "hooks" that let your brain grasp on to concepts and think about them in the background before you read them. You will end up having an easier time understanding the text.
* {page 11-12} Focused Mode Thinking is what is often associated with "problem solving", rationality, and analytical thinking. It is associated with the Pre-Frontal Cortex area of the brain.
* {page 12} Diffuse Mode Thinking is the process of relaxing and letting you mind wander. This mode allows you to make broad connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. This then allows us to see the "big picture" and think outside the box to solve problems.
* {page 13-16} A metaphor for the difference between these modes of thinking is a Pinball Machine with varying levels of tightly packed bumpers. Focused Mode Thinking would have all the bumpers being close together, causing the ball to spend a lot of time in one area, but not move to other areas very easily. Diffuse mode thinking, on the other hand, would have all the bumpers spread out across the whole machine, allowing the ball to move across the whole machine and bounce off many different bumpers, but not staying in one area for long. In this metaphor, the pinball machine is the brain, the bumpers are clusters of neurons, the ball is your train of thought. The act of going from Focused Mode to Diffuse Mode would be to allow some of the closely packed neurons to go down, allowing you to process the thought differently.
* {page 16} Math and science often require Focused Mode to be worked out, but they all take more effort than other modes of Focused thinking. This is because the brain is not evolved to understand the abstract mathematical concepts that we have invented.
* {page 17} The Einstellung Effect (pronounced Eye-nshtellung) is a phenomenon that occurs when you struggle to solve a problem due to already having a certain mindset towards solving a problem, but this mindset turns out to be the wrong mindset to have in order to solve a problem. Like trying to figure out an algebra problem using calculus.
* {page 17} It is easy to experience the Einstellung effect because people often skip textbooks and other theory before trying to solve a problem.
	>One significant mistake that students sometimes make in learning math and science is jumping into the water before they learn how to swim. - Barbara Oakley - A Mind for Numbers, page 17

* {page 18} Knowing how to obtain the true, correct solution that's actually relevant to the problem is one of the most valuable skills.
* {page 18} When you come across a new problem or new concept, you don't have the neural pathways required to solve it efficiently. You can make good use of diffuse thinking to try and draw from knowledge in other areas to come to a conclusion.
	>The harder you push your brain to come up with something creative, the less creative your ideas will be. - Shaun Wassell - A Mind for Numbers, page 19

* {page 20} The reason for these two different modes of thinking for existing dates back to early life, animals had to do tasks such as eating food off the ground, Focused Mode, and scanning the horizon for predators, Diffuse Mode.
* {page 20} The left hemisphere of the brain is associated with the Focused Mode of thinking, while the right hemisphere is associated with Diffuse Mode. This is not evidence for "Left brain" vs "right brain" people, as everyone uses both hemispheres equally.
* {page 21} Both Focused and Diffuse modes of thinking are needed to solve a problem, but Diffuse Mode will not activate if we are consciously focusing on it.
	>To learn about and be creative in math and science, we need to strengthen and use both focused and diffuse mods.
* Being confused is something that many students shy away from, including "smart" students who are not used to coming across a problem they can't solve.
* The process of learning heavily relies on the process of going back and forth between Focused Mode and Diffuse Mode, and this is true for learning just about anything.
* When you procrastinate, you do not allow yourself to do any Diffuse Mode thinking.
* To practice Diffuse Mode thinking:
	- After reading a chapter of a book, try to recall the events of the chapter without looking at the book.

* Hearing the same instructions/ideas/concepts in a slightly different way might help you understand it better.

#### Chapter 2: Summery:
There are two main modes of thinking, Focused Mode and Diffused Mode. These modes stem from our evolutionary background. Focused Mode lets us spend a lot of mental energy and thought on one specific problem. This is good for things we already know how to do or a re good at, but we can fall into the "Einstellung Effect" of only looking at a problem with a certain mindset or point of view that is wrong, and will not solve the problem. Diffuse Mode lets our mind wander, and allows our brain to come up with a solution to a problem by approaching it from a different point of view, with a different mindset. It draws from other areas and ideas that we already know. We can take advantage of this by taking time away from a hard problem to think about something else for a while, or even go to sleep. Our brain will still work on the problem and use Diffuse Mode to come up with solutions.

### Chapter 3:
* {page 29-30} While many people switch in and out of Focused Mode and Diffuse Mode by accident, many great people of the past have used techniques to shift between mental modes extremely quickly. Thomas Edison took a nap, but held a ball bearing in his hand, that was over a frying-pan. As he was going to sleep, and starting thinking in Diffuse Mode, he would drop the ball bearing and wake himself up, remembering all the ideas he thought of.
* {page 30} Math and science are creative forms of thinking just as much as painting and writing are.
* {page 32} Creativity is not just about having a set of artistic or logical capabilities, it is the ability to harness and develop your ideas and abilities. Everyone has the ability to form new connections in their brain
* {page 33} Failure results in learning just as much as success, maybe even more.
* {page 33-34} Keep work sessions short. You only have so much mental energy you can use in Focus Mode thinking.
* {page 33} You always enter Diffuse Mode when you stop actively thinking about and working on something
* {page 34} Sleep is one of the most effective forms of Diffuse Mode thinking, but don't abuse it or you won't get anywhere.
* {page 36} Avoid the idea that you have to work as hard and learn as fast as anyone else. Make sure to keep your workload at a reasonable level. Learning it a good pace will result in you understanding the material better.
* {page 37} Going into Diffuse Mode is a good way to avoid the Einstellung effect.
	>Figuring out a difficult problem or learning a new concept almost always requires on or more periods where you aren't consciously working on the problem
* {page 39} A session of Diffuse Mode should last about a few hours. No longer than a day
* {page 39} Diffuse mode also allows you to process the information and assimilate it into what you already know.
* {page 42} Working Memory is the the part of your memory that handles what is immediately happening and what your are consciously thinking about. While it used to be believed that you can hold about 7 chunk of information, it is now believed that you can only hold about 4. Working Memory is like a blackboard for your mind that allows you to focus on a few concepts you are trying to understand.
* {page 43} Long Term Memory is the more well known type of memory. The kind of memory that stores all the information you have such as weird words, your address, basic artistic and scientific concepts, etc.
* {page 44-45} The reason sleep is so effective and important in health and in the learning process is because it allows toxins in our brain to be flushed out, literally cleaning out our brain and allowing it to run more effectively. The pre-frontal cortex also deactivates and allows the rest of the brain to function better. Going over material or working on a hard problem right before you go to sleep will increase the chances of your Diffuse Mode working on it (and of you dreaming about it). Doing anything on a lack of sleep is significantly more effective.

#### CHAPTER 3 SUMMERY:
Chapter 3 talked about methods and the importance of switching between Focused and Diffuse Modes of thinking. It touched on the main two types of memory that we have, and it also talked about the importance and effectiveness of sleep in the learning process.
