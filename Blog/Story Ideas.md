### Jazz Superman
If The Batman is a grungy batman movie, Jazz Superman (name subject to change) is a fun superman movie. Jazz soundtrack, with the visual style of old 50s paintings matching the time that Superman was invented. Think Incredibles. Probably a comic

### Space earth repair thing
Inspired by that one remix of the Interstellar theme with the anime backing and sample that ISNT ON YOUTBE ANYMORE, this is a story about some astronauts in space fixing some craft in a mass scale effort to repair the planet from (??????). Solarpunk-ish. Probably a short story/comic

### Better RWBY
A story about a group of people; Weiss (transgener), Naive Ruby, Soft bot Jaune, Strong girl who dies Pyrrha, Quiet communist Blake, Strong Girls Yang. The story has themes of freedom, autonomy, abuse, and self discovery.

### Femboy brain molko story
Femboy and Chad escape zombies/vampires
