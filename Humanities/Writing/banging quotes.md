"An unwelcome consequence of living in a world where everything is “easy” is that the only skill that matters is the ability to multitask." (this is not good because multitasking sucks ass)

"At the extreme, we don’t actually do anything; we only arrange what will be done, which is a flimsy basis for a life." - Rekka

"The suburbs dream of violence. Asleep in their drowsy villas, sheltered by benevolent shopping malls, they wait patiently for the nightmares that will wake them into a more passionate world." - JG Ballard (It should be noted that this quote was accompanied by a picture of a suburban family all holding ar-15s)

“You are not compelled to form any opinion about this matter before you, nor to disturb your peace of mind at all. Things in themselves have no power to extort a verdict from you.” - Marcus Aurelius

"You can eat all the junk food you want, you just have to cook it yourself"

"A lifestyle today without tech addictions in a "modern context"? That's a good question. Best answer I that can think of - you minimize your dependency on today's tech so that you only use it when necessary. That includes some pre-Internet lifestyles. For example, instead of using your smartphone as a bedside alarm clock, you use a standalone alarm clock so you're not tempted by the Internet while in bed. Or you downgrade your phone to a dumbphone so you're not carrying the Internet with you at all times. You learn to think ahead, plan ahead, and be self-reliant. You make thoughtful decisions and actions, not impulsive decisions and actions. You get into a daily rhythm - you start the day, you go through the day, you wind down and shut down at the end of the day, and you get off the 24/7 "always on" treadmill."

"Three years ago I was making iOS applications  
Two years ago ago Apple broke all my iOS apps with one of their pointless updates.  
Then I installed Linux  
Then I learnt 6502 assembly  
Then I learnt scheme  
Then I learnt pascal  
Then my Macbook died  
Then I started learning C  
Then I installed Plan9.
Funny how things work out" - Devine Lu Linvega

"When you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow & exclude people. So create."

"We believe that one can use nature's indifference as a reminder of the actual fortitude of their being, to learn of one's own true capacity for resilience when communing with nature — Ideas altogether at odds with modern stories, or an invitation to be part of something." - Hundred Rabbits — North Pacific Logbook

"No, you don't need to learn modern C++ to do audio programming. You don't even need C++. Most audio DSP code is just arithmetic with the occasional trig function. I've gotten by all these years using nothing but conventional C, most of it conforming to standard ANSI C.
No, you don't need to learn JUCE to do audio programming. It's a massive complexity to deal with that makes the wrong things easier to do.
If you *need* stuff to work in a DAW, just pick one specific architecture format to study, preferably an open source one like VST3 or LV2. If you're not interested in building graphical UIs, LADSPA is the simplest one I've come across.
Otherwise, if you *need* stuff to work in real-time, consider building something like a native PD/SC plugin. Those environments are more extendable than conventional DAWs. They also tend to be simpler plugin formats.
But really, you should just cut out realtime/plugins and do offline processing with audio files. Less code, easier to understand, and easier to debug."

"In attempting to tackle the difficult UX challenges of that space, unrealizing that my failure to solve these issues might very well come from the simple fact that the purpose of operating systems is to enable multi-tasking, multi-tasking that I try to eradicate from my daily life, making these issues deeply unsolvable and my love for sharp tools and OSes irreconcilable." - Devine Lu Linvega

"Merveilles seems aligned with the ideals of Solarpunk while internally expecting the world of Cyberpunk, it is neither a utopian or dystopian vision, but a way of straddling both contingencies."

"A Hacker Manifesto (2004), as the “hacker class,” the producers of novelty and the intellectual laborers of the information economy. These programmers, musicians, artists, academics, and other “creatives” are exploited by the “vectoralist class” who, like capitalists in the industrial world, control the distribution of cognitive products."

"Marvelous pursuits are a means to resist alienation from one's environment because they are a temporary means to make that environment one's own, by ascribing one's own, often bizarre, value for things and spaces.
The marvelous pursuit often creates complexity but a complexity which is opposed to that of the technician. The master of a marvelous pursuit can never be an engineer because the marvelous is by nature useless to society (and therefore to capital)."

“But the 8-hour workday is too profitable for big business, not because of the amount of work people get done in eight hours (the average office worker gets less than three hours of actual work done in 8 hours) but because it makes for such a purchase-happy public. Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, and any other relief they can buy. It keeps them watching television, and its commercials. It keeps them unambitious outside of work. We’ve been led into a culture that has been engineered to leave us tired, hungry for indulgence, willing to pay a lot for convenience and entertainment, and most importantly, vaguely dissatisfied with our lives so that we continue wanting things we don’t have. We buy so much because it always seems like something is still missing.”

"the imposing lack of natural light, the strangely calculated aisle widths (staggered, so you must look at the endcaps), milk in the back even though you can tell there's cold-chain product in the front. You walk away from the main chaos to come to a deserted apparel section, and the din of moving carts and cellphone conversations lifts. you hear Muskrat Love being tinnily played over the intercom, and wonder what Captain & Tennille were thinking to themselves when they realized the In-Store Audio Network were paying them $0.25 a month in royalties, probably back in 2013 or so.
you consider picking up a pack of gum at the checkout, but decide to spare your poor left temporomandibular joint the stress. at least the din has drowned out the tinnitus the joint caused"

"I have forced myself to contradict myself in order to avoid conforming to my own tastes."  - Marcel Duchamp

"stop posting things you don't care about, it's heartless, it's a kind of abuse, it assumes and implicitly asserts that neither you nor your friends should value their attention very highly"

"- lower the friction - make it super easy to make an entry. If it's paper, use bookmarks and have a writing implement attached to your book/etc. If it's digital, create a bookmark, an ios workflow, an email system - something that makes it super easy to write something. I write most of my posts using an XMPP chat bot, but that is much more complicated than necessary  
- lower the bar - you don't have to write a descriptive essay for each entry. Just write something. Many of my entries are as simple as "woke up early. grumpy" or "lots of ideas today" or "I love indian food"  
- read your journal often - I have gained a staggering amount of self-insight by reading what I wrote, even days later. Reading 8-year-old entries is even more enlightening  
- If you have any sort of chronic illness, mental or otherwise, having a journal can make it easier to handle, track your moods and feelings, etc. I often use my journal as a resource when dealing with my health and self-care"

"What they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show 'Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done.' " - Richard Stallman

"in a way, it's impossible for me to pin down what my aesthetic would be. I almost feel like I don't want to tie myself in any particular direction by declaring anything my aesthetic, because it entirely changes depending on my mood and all kinds of other things."

"Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta." - Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov

"The silence is deafening" (said to break or describe an awkward or tense silence)

"We knew the world would not be the same. Few people laughed. Few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” I suppose we all thought that, one way or another." - J. Robert Oppenheimer

The Venn - The overlapping space in a Venn Diagram

"if you remove multiple users and communication with other devices from the equation entirely, the vast majority of personal computers could be vastly more simple from the bottom up.
For accomplishing intimate, small-scale tasks focused on creating and not on consuming, this strikes me as the way forward." - Δῃάνειρα 

"build things that suggest and expose how they are made without documentation.
then, provide documentation to clarify, assure the observer of their assumptions, satisfy their intrigue, fill in their blanks, and remove misunderstanding from the equation." - Δῃάνειρα

"Modernity attempts to degrade out ability to pay attention. It seeks to have us believe that we can have everything at a moment’s notice, without thought for payment, patience or production. If one does not pay for something they will not value it. If one does not work at something they will not empathize with it. And if one does not produce something they will not understand it. Modernity removes each and every single one of these factors by way of credit, addictive mechanisms and consumerism." - Devine

"When finished objects become commodities and break, they are easily replaced. When you break a chair, you buy another chair. We know well how to make one thousand chairs. But when a unique object breaks, we might mend. To learn the skill of mending is to also gain the skill of building, to understand the very urge to build. If we never mend, we not only risk building less but building in perverse ways.
To mend is to comprehend a human scale problem, and without this understanding our creations become strange creatures. The more finished goods become commodities, the fewer opportunities an individual has to generate new creation. The ability to mass-produce removes the opportunity for the great many to learn to produce at all." - Devine

"Capitalism doesn't require that a profit be made on the production of capital goods because profits are made through the control of the circulation of consumer goods. Anything that decreases the cost of capital consequently increases the potential profit that can be captured through the sale of the goods.
Failure to understand the difference between capital demand and consumer demand propagates the myth that the success of free software can be a template for free culture. Under capitalism, only capital can be free. That's why software can be free, but culture cannot be free without more fundamental shifts in society." - Devine

"If you feel like everyone hates you, you need to sleep. If you feel like you hate everyone else, you need to eat."

""**Aesthetic realism** holds beauty to be a real property of works of art, there to be discovered by the discerning viewer.  
**Ontological realism** holds that physical objects exist independently of our own minds.  
**Epistemological realism** is the view that statements are true, or false, independently of whether we believe them to be true or false." - Adapted from Baggini & Fosl, The Philosopher's Toolkit

"Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it. I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free." -Michelangelo, Lettera a messer Benedetto Varchi

"In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness." -Antoine de St. Exupery, Terre des Hommes

"When you will have made him a body without organs, then you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions and restored him to his true freedom. -Antonin Artaud, To Have Done with the Judgment of God

"The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain." -Ursula K. Le Guin, The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas

"One never reaches a horizon. It is not a line; it has no place; it encloses no field; its location is always relative to the view. To move toward a horizon is simply to have a new horizon. A horizon is a phenomenon of vision. One cannot look at the horizon; it is simply the point beyond which we cannot see. There is nothing in the horizon itself, however, that limits vision, for the horizon opens onto all that lies beyond itself. What limits vision is rather the incompleteness of that vision. -James P. Carse, Finite and Infinite Games

"They did not know it was impossible, so they did it." -Mark Twain

"No limiting qualities are to be attributed to the **Absolute**." -Plutarch, Convivalium Disputationum libri novem

"Be mindful of impermanence. Be careful of idleness."

"Many people are afraid of Emptiness, because it reminds them of Loneliness."

"What is joy? Joy is the feeling of passing from a lesser to a greater perfection. Joy is the feeling that we are advancing towards happiness. What is happiness? Happiness is the state of the soul that feels itself free of all outside servitudes and feels itself in perfect accord with itself." - Devine

"Stop buying the unnecessary, stop doing the non-essential."
