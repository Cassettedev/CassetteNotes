## We will face this reality honestly and learn how to live with it.

We realize that the current and upcoming crises cannot be reduced to a set of problems in need of technological or political solutions. We believe that the roots of the current and upcoming crises lie in the stories we have been telling ourselves.

Collapse won't be addressed by buying a Prius, signing a treaty, or turning off the air-conditioning. The biggest problem we face is a philosophical one: understanding that this civilization is already dead. The sooner we confront this problem, and the sooner we realize thereâ€™s nothing we can do to save ourselves, the sooner we can get down to the hard work of adapting, with mortal humility, to our new reality.

The **myth of progress** tells us that we are destined for greatness, that we began grunting in the primeval swamps, as a humble part of something called _nature_, which we have now triumphantly subdued.

It came to be understood among the people of our culture that life in _the wild_ was governed by a single, cruel law known as "kill or be killed." In recent decades, ethologists have discovered that this law is a fiction. In fact, a system of laws, universally observed, preserves the tranquility of the wild, protects species and even individuals, and promotes the well-being of the community as a whole. This system of laws has been called, among other things, the peacekeeping law, the law of limited competition, and _animal ethics_.

### regenerative sustainability

-   **Integrity**: Maintaining the wholeness of wider systems, ensuring that structure and relationships remain intact and functioning as they should.
-   **Inclusivity**: Interacting with the world in its entirety, engaging and integrating with all dimensions, levels of existence and knowledge.
-   **Harmony**: All elements cooperate through relationships that are respectful in order to avoid dissonance.
-   **Respect**: All parts of the world have intrinsic worth and all existence is part of the extended self, and therefore all self-respect is extended to mutual respect for the world.
-   **Mutuality**: Compassion, treating others the same as yourself.
-   **Positive reciprocity**: Reciprocating in a way that is of benefit to and advances the relationship between self and extended self.
-   **Fellowship**: An extension of mutuality and positive reciprocity, where the world is co-created by humans in partnership with nature.
-   **Responsibility**: Morally accountability for the consequences of our actions in an uncertain and unpredictable world.
-   **Humility**: Change is constant, we cannot know the true consequences of our actions.
-   **Non-attachment**: In order to adapt to changing circumstances it is important to uphold non-attachment in order to decouple from the futility of trying to hold onto anything in an ever changing world including ideas, dogmas and strategies.

### Animal Rights

-   **Animal Liberation Front**: An international, leaderless resistance that engages in removing animals from laboratories and farms, destroying facilities, arranging safe houses and veterinary care, and operating sanctuaries where the animals subsequently live.
-   **Animal Advocacy**: Promotion of the interests of animals, generally. Includes work for animal rights and animal welfare.
-   **Commodification**: The conversion of a living being, principle, or natural environment into an "object" that is used, exchanged, or consumed for profit or other desired gain.
-   **Debarking**: The surgical removal and manipulation of tissue in a dog's vocal cords to drastically quiet his or her natural bark. Debarking does not address the underlying reasons that a dog may be barking excessively, and the dog will continue to bark, albeit more quietly or silently.
-   **Draize Test**: Infamous and excruciating eye-irritation test for household products and cosmetics in which drops of a substance are placed in the eyes of rabbits, causing the animals ulcers, blindness, and other injuries before they are ultimately killed.
-   **Flowerpot Technique**: A technique used in sleep deprivation studies designed to allow NREM sleep but prevent REM sleep.
-   **Forced Molting**: The egg-industry practice of artificially inducing hens to molt by depriving them of food for several days to two weeks when their egg production has declined.
-   **Rape Rack**: The industry term referring to the contraptions in which cows and pigs are restrained while they are forcibly inseminated.
-   **Veal Crate**: Small crate in which a calf being raised for veal is confined and tied up. The calf's movement within the crate is intentionally restricted to limit the strengthening of muscle, and an insufficient diet is provided intentionally to keep the cow anemic.

When advocating lifestyles that abandon maximalism, it is important to frame it in a positive way. Settling for simple and coarse things does not need to be a "sacrifice" but something genuinely better than the mainstream alternative.
