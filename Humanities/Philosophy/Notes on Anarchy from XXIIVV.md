## Anarchy means not necessarily the absence of order but an absence of rule.

Anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems of control including but not limited to the state, capitalism, racism, sexism, ableism, speciesism, and religion.

Anarchists wish to create a society based upon individual freedom and voluntary cooperation. Anarchism is founded on the observation that since only a few are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.

Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.

To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same. Anarchists fight for a society which respects individuals and their freedom, and believe in peace at any price â€” except at the price of liberty.

Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a person.

>The individual cannot bargain with the State. The State recognizes no coinage but power: and it issues the coins itself.

-Ursula K. Le Guin, The Dispossessed

>Violence is the base governing system for debt.

A just society would be one in which liberty for one person is constrained only by the demands created by equal liberty for another.
