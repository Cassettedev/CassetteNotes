Only the mediocre are always at their best

----------------------------------

-   Doing the right tasks is more important than doing your tasks efficiently.
-   Write down your goals. Break them down into manageable tasks.
-   Tackle one task at a time, and group similar tasks together.
-   You're more attentive in the morning, tackle hard stuff then.
-   If you can't do it in 8 hours, you can't do it in 10.
-   Don't forget to stretch, and drink plenty of water.
-   Keep a record of your time use.

----

-   Write simple modular parts connected by clean interfaces.
-   When a program must fail, it should fail noisily and as soon as possible.
-   Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
-   Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
-   Write programs to write programs when you can.

Each project should aim to persist across technological Long Term, 
not one part of it should be prebuilt, precompiled, or minified — 
Every method should be specific, unobfuscated, and each one carefully 
chosen against general-purpose libraries, frameworks or wasteful foreign entities.

Using these tools should be frictionless and undisruptive, 
their formats and subsequent products versionable, re-purposable, 
interpretable and text-editable. Only through open sources, open standards, 
human-readable formats and their independencies, might they survive this 
fleeting age of self-destructing informatics.

These attributes should not only be perceptible in their design, 
but deeply rooted in their code.

> Your creative output spans several disciplines - a big reason why I enjoy your work - while a goal of yours is preventing multi-tasking. Can you define what unproductive multi-tasking looks like to you vs. what have you found to be a productive way to shift your focus from one discipline to another?

It comes down to scope and granularity. The **ideal focused work** to me is a session of _25:00 pomodoro_. Undistracted, focusing on a single task, with a single tool, undisturbed. Then, throughout the day, the relationship between each of the pomodoros, would be done for a singular project.

An unproductive multi-tasking day, would include interrupted sessions of pomodoros, over multiple unrelated projects.

> In your tracking, I like that you differentiate between focused input, like listening to music, and output, like performing music. How do you decide what is an appropriate output of something you are curious about and what's your process like to allocate the right about time towards it?

Ideally, I would like to optimise for [concrete output](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/horaire), so output that yield the highest form of product, ex: _releasing things, instead of endlessly tooling_. But I can't simply chain days of hard concrete output, especially as my work becomes increasingly complex.

-   There was a time when I would just draw all day, and release the finished lineart at the end of the day. But then I started coloring, animating, using these drawings as assets in games, and interactive experience, and into the context of larger project arcs and so on.. As the project got more complex, the more planning and tooling I had to do.

I have enough project histories, that when I am to start a new project, I can estimate how many hours will be required roughly based on a [previously completed similar project](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/oquonie:journal), as you would with any task tracker. As for the day-to-day, I tend to follow the [Horaire tools](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/dashboard), as it calculates the optimal task(concrete output code), or my remaining concrete output "stamina", based on previous streaks of similar sequences of logs.

> In the process of using the Horaire Log over the past years, what was the biggest adjustment you made (to the log, to your lifestyle) that paid off?

Making logging rapid and unhindering. The hardest thing about logging, is logging itself, and to keep doing it. Optimizing redundant logs, turning them into quick codes, like the fh/ch codes to generate the task/hour made this whole process a lot more fun. Giving instant feedback, through dataviz for instance, was excellent too.

The biggest adjustment to my lifestyle, that I made recently, that yeilded the biggest difference, was to record more data. I've recently pushed this further, and started offloading almost all thought that goes through my mind at all time onto this digital paper. It has slowed time, helped me with focus and mindfulness.

"Educate yourself, so you can be part of the conversation. Learn something scientific, something mathematic. Explore philosophy. Study paleontology. Try to learn a new language. You don’t even have to make fluency your goal, just get a few more words in your head. Listen to an educational podcast. Professors from colleges are offering their lectures online for free. One of my greatest challenges as a teacher was convincing students they were smart after someone had told them they were dumb."

"People trying to get food on the table tomorrow don’t give a damn about climate change 10 years from now. We can’t stop these people burning wood for fuel. Not unless we have an alternative. There’s no moral high ground here - morality doesn’t come into the picture unless your basic needs are met."

i feel like a lot of the time "capitalism" is more of a stand-in for civilization or empire with the way people usually talk about it in everyday speech. but that also obscures how old many of these dynamics are. you can often say quite similar things about mercantilism, feudalism, the economies of ancient rome, china, egypt, or the mediterranean bronze age societies. and probably many more. the ascendancy of capitalism is quite recent and depends on very specific ideas about joint ownership with shares and legal arrangements, but hierarchical arrangements (often but not always linked more to families and kinship) with many of the same dominating effects are far older.

placing all of this on "capitalism" makes it seem as if you can swap out a "system" which is not particularly old with something else which is "better". but i think the "problem" is much more daunting than that because these impulses are so woven into culture and everyday attitudes which makes these dominating patterns even more enduring.

this kind of talk of "economic models" and "production" in the abstract also feels disempowering to me in how it places an emphasis on things i have no control over and de-emphasizes or disparages what i can actually do because it "won't make a difference". but living in different ways and relating to others how i want, inside or outside of prevailing social attitudes does make a difference, to me. and it makes a difference to the people i choose to share my life with, all of us living under the shade of giant lumbering monsters called capitalism or empire or civilization. i will be happy for these beasts to die, but i don't feel any obligation to make that my project or worry that i can never truly be free or happy while they continue to roam. i feel like my life would not be very different either way.

Feynman’s calculus notes illustrate one of the famous physicist’s defining qualities: his insatiable curiosity. His famous autobiographical anecdotes often involve him learning about subjects ranging from Mayan hieroglyphics to bongo drums and cat anatomy. When he found a subject that interested him, he was not about to wait for the right teacher to come along; he was determined to master it himself. - https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.5.9099/full/

There are two types of happiness, Hedonic and Eudaimonic. Hedonic is the "simple pleasures" like eating good food, watching a fun movie, having a nice party, etc etc. Eudaimonic is "meaningful", like finishing a passion project, having a baby, finishing school with a high grade, etc etc. Neither of these things are bad forms of happiness, but it's clear that eudaimonic happiness has a lasting impact, while hedonic is fleeting.
