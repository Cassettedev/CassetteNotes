# The inbox is a collection of things that do not yet have a place

>We often think of our mind and body as separate, but our mental health and physical health are interconnected. **Physical health problems significantly increase our risk of developing mental health problems, and vice versa**.

Only the mediocre are always at their best

----------------------------------

-   Doing the right tasks is more important than doing your tasks efficiently.
-   Write down your goals. Break them down into manageable tasks.
-   Tackle one task at a time, and group similar tasks together.
-   You're more attentive in the morning, tackle hard stuff then.
-   If you can't do it in 8 hours, you can't do it in 10.
-   Don't forget to stretch, and drink plenty of water.
-   Keep a record of your time use.

-   Write simple modular parts connected by clean interfaces.
-   When a program must fail, it should fail noisily and as soon as possible.
-   Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
-   Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
-   Write programs to write programs when you can.

Each project should aim to persist across technological Long Term, 
not one part of it should be prebuilt, precompiled, or minified — 
Every method should be specific, unobfuscated, and each one carefully 
chosen against general-purpose libraries, frameworks or wasteful foreign entities.

Using these tools should be frictionless and undisruptive, 
their formats and subsequent products versionable, re-purposable, 
interpretable and text-editable. Only through open sources, open standards, 
human-readable formats and their independencies, might they survive this 
fleeting age of self-destructing informatics.

These attributes should not only be perceptible in their design, 
but deeply rooted in their code.

> Your creative output spans several disciplines - a big reason why I enjoy your work - while a goal of yours is preventing multi-tasking. Can you define what unproductive multi-tasking looks like to you vs. what have you found to be a productive way to shift your focus from one discipline to another?

It comes down to scope and granularity. The **ideal focused work** to me is a session of _25:00 pomodoro_. Undistracted, focusing on a single task, with a single tool, undisturbed. Then, throughout the day, the relationship between each of the pomodoros, would be done for a singular project.

An unproductive multi-tasking day, would include interrupted sessions of pomodoros, over multiple unrelated projects.

> In your tracking, I like that you differentiate between focused input, like listening to music, and output, like performing music. How do you decide what is an appropriate output of something you are curious about and what's your process like to allocate the right about time towards it?

Ideally, I would like to optimise for [concrete output](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/horaire), so output that yield the highest form of product, ex: _releasing things, instead of endlessly tooling_. But I can't simply chain days of hard concrete output, especially as my work becomes increasingly complex.

-   There was a time when I would just draw all day, and release the finished lineart at the end of the day. But then I started coloring, animating, using these drawings as assets in games, and interactive experience, and into the context of larger project arcs and so on.. As the project got more complex, the more planning and tooling I had to do.

I have enough project histories, that when I am to start a new project, I can estimate how many hours will be required roughly based on a [previously completed similar project](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/oquonie:journal), as you would with any task tracker. As for the day-to-day, I tend to follow the [Horaire tools](http://wiki.xxiivv.com/dashboard), as it calculates the optimal task(concrete output code), or my remaining concrete output "stamina", based on previous streaks of similar sequences of logs.

> In the process of using the Horaire Log over the past years, what was the biggest adjustment you made (to the log, to your lifestyle) that paid off?

Making logging rapid and unhindering. The hardest thing about logging, is logging itself, and to keep doing it. Optimizing redundant logs, turning them into quick codes, like the fh/ch codes to generate the task/hour made this whole process a lot more fun. Giving instant feedback, through dataviz for instance, was excellent too.

The biggest adjustment to my lifestyle, that I made recently, that yeilded the biggest difference, was to record more data. I've recently pushed this further, and started offloading almost all thought that goes through my mind at all time onto this digital paper. It has slowed time, helped me with focus and mindfulness.

"Educate yourself, so you can be part of the conversation. Learn something scientific, something mathematic. Explore philosophy. Study paleontology. Try to learn a new language. You don’t even have to make fluency your goal, just get a few more words in your head. Listen to an educational podcast. Professors from colleges are offering their lectures online for free. One of my greatest challenges as a teacher was convincing students they were smart after someone had told them they were dumb."

"People trying to get food on the table tomorrow don’t give a damn about climate change 10 years from now. We can’t stop these people burning wood for fuel. Not unless we have an alternative. There’s no moral high ground here - morality doesn’t come into the picture unless your basic needs are met."
