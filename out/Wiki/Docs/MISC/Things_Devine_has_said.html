<blockquote>
<p>You seem very stable mentally and emotionally, at least from the outside. Is that an accurate perception? Or is that just how you appear through the lens of social media?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's possible that I am, but the way I see it, I might have <strong>less of an emotional dynamic range</strong> than some people, I definitely also oscillate between better and worse moods, but less intense highs and lows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You track lots of things about yourself; do you also track your mood? And do you make an effort to fight it or to stabilize it, or do you just try to &quot;go with the flow&quot; and let your mood dictate your workflow?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't track my moods, but as my <strong>moods usually follow my tracked input/output</strong>, so moods can be inferred. I am happiest when I get to dedicate myself fully to any one task. So, that being said, tracking the way I do, can be seen as stabilizing my moods? I never have professional frustration, and I can very easily imagine that affecting my moods. To go with the flow, you have to be able to see the flow, what you're asking me is if I just wing it, and I never wing it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have any rituals, habits, or practices that keep you mentally and emotionally healthy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have collected some habits <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/knowledge">here</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Doing the right tasks is more important than doing your tasks efficiently.</li>
<li>Write down your goals. Break them down into manageable tasks.</li>
<li>Tackle one task at a time, and group similar tasks together.</li>
<li>You're more attentive in the morning, tackle hard stuff then.</li>
<li>If you can't do it in 8 hours, you can't do it in 10.</li>
<li>Don't forget to stretch, and drink plenty of water.</li>
<li>Keep a record of your time use.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you make an effort to avoid any particular thoughts or behaviors?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The best test of a person's character is how they treats those with less power.</li>
<li>Err on the side of optimism and positive energy in all things.</li>
<li>If you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.</li>
<li>You get what you expect from people.</li>
<li>Don’t waste your time on gossip.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>What's your philosophy of dealing with or preparing for hard times or for the unexpected? How do you develop resilience, flexibility, and perseverance?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Try to not make long-term plans</strong>. You'll always be better tomorrow at dealing with what's to come, I tend to offload anxiety onto my tomorrow-self, and focus on preparing that fictional self as best as I can. But in general, I don't think about providence too much. Shit happens, I'm grateful to have had the experiences I did, everytime I go sailing, I think that it might be the last, but desptite these thoughts, I just feel grateful that I got this far, everything else is <strong>New Game+</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Your creative output spans several disciplines - a big reason why I enjoy your work - while a goal of yours is preventing multi-tasking. Can you define what unproductive multi-tasking looks like to you vs. what have you found to be a productive way to shift your focus from one discipline to another?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It comes down to scope and granularity. The <strong>ideal focused work</strong> to me is a session of <em>25:00 pomodoro</em>. Undistracted, focusing on a single task, with a single tool, undisturbed. Then, throughout the day, the relationship between each of the pomodoros, would be done for a singular project.</p>
<p>An unproductive multi-tasking day, would include interrupted sessions of pomodoros, over multiple unrelated projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your tracking, I like that you differentiate between focused input, like listening to music, and output, like performing music. How do you decide what is an appropriate output of something you are curious about and what's your process like to allocate the right about time towards it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideally, I would like to optimise for <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/horaire">concrete output</a>, so output that yield the highest form of product, ex: <em>releasing things, instead of endlessly tooling</em>. But I can't simply chain days of hard concrete output, especially as my work becomes increasingly complex.</p>
<ul>
<li>There was a time when I would just draw all day, and release the finished lineart at the end of the day. But then I started coloring, animating, using these drawings as assets in games, and interactive experience, and into the context of larger project arcs and so on.. As the project got more complex, the more planning and tooling I had to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have enough project histories, that when I am to start a new project, I can estimate how many hours will be required roughly based on a <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/oquonie:journal">previously completed similar project</a>, as you would with any task tracker. As for the day-to-day, I tend to follow the <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/dashboard">Horaire tools</a>, as it calculates the optimal task(concrete output code), or my remaining concrete output &quot;stamina&quot;, based on previous streaks of similar sequences of logs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the process of using the Horaire Log over the past years, what was the biggest adjustment you made (to the log, to your lifestyle) that paid off?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making logging rapid and unhindering. The hardest thing about logging, is logging itself, and to keep doing it. Optimizing redundant logs, turning them into quick codes, like the fh/ch codes to generate the task/hour made this whole process a lot more fun. Giving instant feedback, through dataviz for instance, was excellent too.</p>
<p>The biggest adjustment to my lifestyle, that I made recently, that yeilded the biggest difference, was to record more data. I've recently pushed this further, and started offloading almost all thought that goes through my mind at all time onto this digital paper. It has slowed time, helped me with focus and mindfulness.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>How does your horaire logging work if you work on multiple projects, or multiple sectors in one day?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the goals of Horaire is to <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#aesthetics">limit multitasking</a>, I do one thing only, one sector, all day. If you don't care to multi-task, you could use a timestamp alongside your logs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like if you spent a day hiking, listening to philosophy podcasts and meditating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are all sources of input.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or a better example probably just doing some audio design for markl but then fixing bugs for a few hours</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not something I would do. Jumping from audio to programming like this, is a bad idea for me. The way I would do this is to plan a long day of audio, find a task that would take the whol day, or stop early and go read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m thinking of trying to go vegan, and am giving it somewhat of an attempt after being inspired by you &amp; Rekka. If you feel comfortable, would you mind telling me the reasons that led to you deciding to do so, and how long you’ve been vegan?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rekka and I both had different reasons to turn our diet to an entirely plant-based one. Rekka did the switch faster than I could, so I shall only speak of my own choices.</p>
<p>I was vegetarian for almost 10 years, when we stumbled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_China_Study">The China Study</a>, it initiated a train of thought that would concretize into turning vegan shortly after — But I first had to fully internalise that data to actually apply it. At the time, I was beginning to increasingly question my choices and to validate them against some data or another. Learning about the phisiological changes of consuming meat and dairy, between the China Study and <a href="http://nutritionfacts.org">http://nutritionfacts.org</a>, it became more obvious that my dietary choices did not align with my <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/goals">life-prolonging aspirations</a>.</p>
<p>So, at the time my decision first came from an health stand-point. Later came <strong>moral</strong>, there seemed to be few things that could be as transformative toward a greener future, for earth, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production">getting rid of factory farming and fishing</a>. Humans currently produce food for 10 billion people, but about a third of the crop is fed to animals, which leaves about a <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Should_we_go_vegan%3F">billion people without enough food</a>. Going vegan would go a long way in helping end world hunger. It was becoming clear that if I wanted to act both rationally, and environmentally, I'd have to fully change.</p>
<p>Lastly, I got thinking a lot about speciesim, and came to look into the <strong>ethics</strong> of meat-eating, <em>cultured meat</em>, dairy production, etc... I failed to validate the choice to cosume animal products in any form against <a href="http://philosophizethis.libsyn.com/071-is-killing-animals-for-food-justifiable">any form of rational thought</a>. Reducing human and animal suffering, as well as waste, aligns with my views of behaving rationally on earth.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s the biggest misconception people have about your work – that drives you mad?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have the sense that some may think that I work more than I actually do. I've ran into people blinded by the <em>apparent output</em>, and whom worked themselves up to an unreal expectation of productivity. I've ran into this interesting problem where, the more data I made public, and the more explicit it is that I really only seldom <em>actually sit to do deep work</em>, the less people read the numbers, and blindly presupose that I must be at it endlessly, tirelessly each day of every week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You mentioned that you always set up the purpose of the next day; but do you also set up experimentation spaces?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, they go hand in hand. I usually begin by experimenting as part of the process. You can see my development workflow <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/dotgrid:horaire">here</a>, and it seems to pretty much the same for any project. Maybe I should graph the different ratios for each task, and see how much time I spend doing frameworks, planning and tooling, against actual release output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What advice you’d give to people who may be interested in your field/career path – that others usually may miss or forget?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're sitting in a classroom somewhere, pack up, leave. — Find yourself a <em>mentor</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking about mentors, did you have any when starting your path?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I did not come about in a vaccuum. I had mentors who've helped me build the frameworks to reflect, and mentors who've helped me build the skills to earn a living. In regards to arts and design, I grew up with Depthcore, and Angelworld, where the level of constructive criticism and discourse was kept to very high standards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which is (for you) the purpose of a mentor, and which that of a student?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A mentor will save the student mistakes to be done by being very open and explicit about their process, as opposed to a teacher, who will deliver content outside of its context. The task of the student is to decide which mistakes to replicate and to move past the mentor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you lost all of your following, and had to reduce your new promotion tools to one activity, which one would you choose?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would still use Twitter. It's a nightmare but it's where battles are fought. Where people learn to discourse, get burnt, rise again, change their mind about things. It's the place people go to talk. Facebook and the more private ones, are for people who've had enough, or have been injured by public discourse. I might retread to the more passive social spaces someday myself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And lastly, what other people professionally and artistically inspire you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On my sail to Fiji, I devoured countless hours of EA podcasts and books. I've been feeling increasingly like I should be finding ways to use my work for good. I've been connecting with the Effective Altruism projects, and am trying to find applications where I could help.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Has the action of starting to &quot;seize&quot; your time quickly become automatic?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took me about 2 years to get it right, I populated my logs of 2006 to 2008, with streaks of 40-50 days before giving up and forgetting about the system for a couple of days and weeks. And then trying it again, before, again, giving it up. After some time, I started to find a purpose to this data collection, either from graphing it into meaningful visualisations, or by using it as a base for project planning and time planning. My guess is that it is <strong>never</strong> second nature, it only has to exist in a place that is readily available and useful for it not to be forgotten and unused.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you deal with potential business competition?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, so this is a bit tricky. I don't really log tasks, I log a % of <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#horaire">focus</a> on available hours on a project, each day. For instance, I would log <em>60% on Dotgrid</em> to mean that I have spent 60% of the available time of that day, no matter what the amount of time is. And it is an index of dedication more than a record of time. But since most days are somewhat the same, where I spend at the most about 6-7 hours. I can infer, after such a long time of logging, a pretty good estimate of how long I will have invested doing any one task.</p>
<p>I used to log in a clock-in clock-out fashion, where I would have very detailed data on the tasks I was doing, but it ended up being unmangeable and so repetitive that I failed to find a use for this granularity of data, and I would stop using the system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the correlation with Git? Do you have some sort of &quot;commit:task&quot; mapping?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I only use git to update my site, the site is entirely built to run on git pages. It works without a node server, it's 100% static, and not generated. I enter my daily entries by hand, I've built a database format that's easy to read and update. I don't want to make something that relies too much on git as I have a pretty flaky computer setup, I want something that is not &quot;locked&quot; in any ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What were the motivations for building &quot;your own calendar&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea came from making the clock, I realized that it changed how I looked at the time passing, and I wondered if there wasn't a more useful date system that would do something similar, my guess was that 2 weeks long months, instead of 4 weeks long months, would help by having boundaries(end of month, start of the next) more often. I've only been using for a few weeks now, and I cannot say that it has helped that much, but I'll stick with it anyways, see what happens. It's a lot of fun to use anyways. 26 months of 14 days each, it's quite elegant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the construction of this environment directed by &quot;something other&quot; than the desire to &quot;tell something&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Neauismetica came about as the culture behind a <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/lietal">linguistics project</a>. I was trying to imagine characters speaking a better(read, <strong>denser</strong>) language than ours, what that would sound like, and what these people would be like. And, what would have inspired them to be this way, and so on. So world building is creating a nearly infinite pool of inspiration, but at its core, what really seems to be doing the work here, is the &quot;Five Why Questions&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do they speak this way? The world.</li>
<li>Why is the world made this way? The stars.</li>
<li>Why are there stars? Huh, gravity.</li>
<li>Why is th—</li>
</ul>
<p>Going down to the bottom of the superficiality of just <em>another pretty picture</em> seems to dwell creativity. Creativity, intelligence, imagination, all seem to cross paths at <em>curiosity</em>. Asking the Why questions is a good thread to follow when looking for ideas. It has worked for me for a long time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does it really inspire your daily work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All my work happens in the same world, it helps to create a sort of narative — But most of all, it has created a discipline. It is reflected in other aspects of my life, where curiosity, acted upon as a nature to reverse-engineer, to build things again, to re-invent the wheel — Lessons that I feel I learnt throughout this world building experiment. It applies not only to code, but music, linguistics, illustration, etc. After walking these mental paths, of this fictional world for so long, I'm finding less and less unexplored places tho.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And would you advise the personal development of this kind of universe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, I think it's key to doing this sort of <em>Renaissance</em> work. And people can tell. I feel like I could detect this sort of depth in someone's eye, from a simple conversation over unrelated topics to world-building, if they indeed had such a place at the bottom of their mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To create, for example, coherence?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coherance is one thing, but it's also a habit, a discipline. I heard that bilinguals, trilinguals, etc have shown to be more compassionate. It is said to come from speaking in one's second tongue that as the speaker does the first step in putting themself in the other's shoes, will be more compassionate. My guess is that this sort of pathway exist throughout some aspects of world building, such as doing back-and-forths between one's mental garden and the real world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What led you into design?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure that I have arrived into design <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/2018">yet</a>. But I certainly have been falling toward it from an early age. My first memories of optimizing for aesthetics had to do with evocative video game HUDs. From flight simulators, to turn-based RPGs, I gravitated toward the ones where most of the actual game experience happened within the interface itself. This manifested later in my enjoying of games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online">Eve Online</a> and <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/">Spacechem</a>, where the player seldom ever even leaves the interfaces to look at the actual game context.</p>
<p>In my early internet days, most of my time went onto art communities and design groups. Some of the best memories I have of that era, were that of the countless hours I spent on sites like Shadowness, <a href="http://theangelworld.net">Angelworld</a>, Raster and <a href="http://www.depthcore.com/artist/ikaruga/">Depthcore</a>.</p>

<p>My typical day begins with my eyes closed, at around 7:00am, I tend to try and keep them closed until I have mentally drafted a rough plan of the things I will want to have done by the end of it. I then rise, grind coffee. I usually ever only drink one cup per day.</p>
<p>I immediately set off to complete the task I have eye-closedly planned. No email, no chat. I know myself to have 2 hours of undisturbed flow before the distraction surrounding lunch-time pull me away from the screen. My goal is usually to have done a singular task per day, the daily task is devised in a way that it should take about 3 hours to complete - Across roughly 5 or 6 <a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/clock">pomodoro</a> grinds.</p>
<p>After the last pomodoro, I tend to <a href="http://grimgrains.com">cook</a>. I try as much as possible to take an <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#nutrition">hour for lunch</a> to try and exit the state of flow. The afternoon is spent doing maintenance or superficial work, experiments. But mostly, the afternoon is spent <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#directory">reading and learning</a>. The goal is to build a catalog of exciting things to wake up to the next day and to experiment with. The superficial work that I do involves answering replies onto the various blogs that I visit, merging Pull Requests to the <a href="http://github.com/neauoire">repositories</a> that I collaborate on, editing wikipedia entries(really, mostly just fighting on :talk), answering emails such as this one &amp; so on.</p>
<p>The day end with <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/journal">journaling</a> in which I record the task done, and if any, the lessons learnt. I usually go to sleep with a book, and a highlighter pen. I'm currently reading Caputo's <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/294637/hermeneutics/">Hermeneutics</a>, I overline the things I want to keep for a <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/glossary">later use</a>, or to revisit.</p>

<p>What’s your setup?</p>

<p>I have two different setups, I have a distractionless setup, which is the one with which I am answering this email, and a digital arts setup.</p>

<h3 id="distractionlessrpi">Distractionless(RPi)</h3>
<p>This first setup is a <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#raspberry">raspberry pi</a>, a small 7&quot; screen, and a <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/keyboard">mechanical keyboard</a>. It doesn't even have a desktop environment. The rig is documented <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/computer">here</a>. Its purpose is to read/write longform stuff, browsing long blogpost with nothing besides music to pull me away from the task at hand.</p>

<h3 id="distractionfullosx">Distractionfull(OSX)</h3>
<p>The second setup is an old Macbook Pro with an even older Wacom Tablet. With this one, I do front-end works, be it layouts, websites, apps and games. It has slack, Twitter and all sorts of other distractionwares. It's my early afternoon computer.</p>

<p>Where do you go to get inspired?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I share a small <a href="http://merveilles.slack.com">chat channel</a> with a few online friends and whenever I need a new toy, a new favourite thing or some help I can find it there. While it is not a public place for anyone to visit, my point is instead to suggest that anyone who's looking for inspiration build a place where they can feel at ease to experiment, show works-in-progress and exchange on art and science in a safe place among <a href="http://webring.xxiivv.com">like-minded people</a>.</p>
<p>In truth, I think I find a lot of my ideas while cycling. But that's not really a place either.</p>

<p>What product have you recently seen that made you think this is great design?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few things that gave me this sense of wonder, although they are not necessarily products. Among the ones that has given me vertigo with how good of a design it had, was the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carrick-bend-Guten-Verrill-modified.png">Carrick Bend</a>&quot; knot. It's a simple knot, but it is infinitely pleasing aesthetically. I've recently learnt how to make an <a href="https://www.pinterest.jp/pin/1548181097703821/">origami pentagon</a>, and this, also, has blown me away with its elegance and simplicity.</p>

<p>What design challenges do you face at your company?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two main challenges of hosting a studio aboard a <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/pino">sailboat</a> are: power, and internet connectivity. We currently power our studio's <a href="http://100r.co/resources.html">battery bank with solar panels</a>. Internet is only available when near the shore, and in most cases, we are anchored outside and away from the cities. Over time, you begin building around the more power-efficient applications and stay away from software that require constant <a href="http://100r.co/resources.html#internet">internet connectivity</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve referred to you before as a multi-disciplinary artist. Do you think this title is fitting?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think so. Yet, I have a sense that I could only ever present myself in such a way in some damp church basement, in deep shame. &quot;Hello, I'm a multi-disciplinary artist&quot;, I would say, my homologues clapping at my confessing and welcome me as one of their own; as multi-disciplinary comes invariably with &quot;..and master of none&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When did you start to focus on creative output? What made you want to?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was fall, all my friends were going back to school, and I was at home. It appeared at the time that I was stuck, that on that day when I decided to not return to school I forfeited my dreams of making video games, of traveling, or becoming a musician. I wrote in a spreadsheet the date and that it had been spent awaste. The next day, again. The third day, again, and after a few days or weeks, of alternating between playing video games and recording my inactivity, I finally logged a handful of hours spent writing music. Then a few more designing a Flash website a couple of days later, then came streaks of 3, or 4, subsequent days. After a while, I had enough at stake, or to loose, from breaking a streak that I woke up and immediately got to work -- to work on doing all the things, and to finance my dreams of travel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What disciplines did you start with, creatively? How did you add on to that, or how did you shift to other mediums?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first, I stumbled unto photo manipulation. From DeviantArt, to Raster and to Depthcore, I was moving from working with photos, to drawing; toward modelling. While I enjoyed visual art, its application didn't excite me nearly as did music writing. Days, and weeks, vanished. I could go on just synthesizing sounds and tracks, and seldom move at all for long periods. But sounds eventually paled, to the intensity of the power that came with programming. It was like discovering a new dimension, interactibility. I was building websites, it mattered not that had a topic, I would go on an making websites about it. Like little shrines dedicated to the praise of their own envelopes. They were promptly built, then they were forgotten. Because, nothing could rival with my newly found passion into procedural art. Interactive graphics, and games! Which, in turn, vanished in the longest shadow of all shadows, generative music. But then-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have a set of very disparate knowledge and interests. How does that knowledge complement itself? How does it work together?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might look disparate from the outside, but I could trace each like you would a genealogy tree. I've always chosen my battles carefully, and have tried to stay at an arm's length of anything I love, if only to admire it whole. There are things I do not touch, subjective topics like politics and religion. I tend to learn only the thing I need to the accomplishment of a task, nothing more. I don't have anything one would call &quot;general interests&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does having such a wide pool to draw from make you more productive?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being independent streamlines the output process as there are no dialog involved with others than myself. But again, there are no dialog involved with others than myself. So, no. It's only different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ve written about your workflow and how you find it best to do [one] thing at a time. How are you able to focus yourself on one task?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I go to bed choosing one thing to accomplish for the next day, I wake up to tackle this single task. I tend to work only in the morning, get everything done before lunch. The afternoons, I spend mostly reading and learning things to help me solve the next day's.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is Merveilles? How did this group form?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Merveilles is a genre I suppose, more than a group. Maybe it's a movement, I'm not sure. It might be that we all grew up with similar influences, yet it might not. Sometimes I think it's a style of going about art, but again, it also applies to musician and programmers. But when we see each other, we know.</p>
<p>Natural languages are so flawed, it reveals things of cognition that I foolishly wanted to suppress. Lietal is one of these experiments where you build a tool to circumvent an issue, only to realize that your tool is imbued with the same problems - But in the process, you understand the problems better. Lietal lives in my work now, it's one of the projects I am most proud of, and one I can always turn to, to remind me of this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Language shows something interesting about the culture it stems from, revealing something of the philosophy it was devised from. What sort of focus is conveyed through Lietal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's the amongst the truer forms of who I am. It's equally, or more, revealing of myself than the body of work I have built in music and illustration.</p>

<h3 id="living-by-proxies">Living by proxies</h3>
<p>Smart devices to take away the pain of thinking deep thoughts, social things against the solitude, forever removing ourselves, in exchange for protectedness, for a complete thoughtless socialized inexistence.</p>
<p>A creeping numbness might be to blame for our own search of this direct experience, in the form of long distance sailing, to let ourselves feel cold so we could sense the subtler changes in the weather, to go hungry to appreciate simpler foods.</p>
<p>Similarly, one might begin to talk instead of watching talk-shows and to play instead of watching game shows — To value the entire spectrum of sensations as necessary members of the whole that is the deliberate existence, with its potential for failure, awkwardness, loneliness, harm and death included.</p>
<h3 id="to-feel-secure">To feel secure</h3>
<p>Convenience products will protect those living at odds with nature. Novel and fashionable horrors will be popularized to subvert anyone into docility, else new fears will be provided as obedience demands.</p>
<p>In the name of security, a modern citizen will be thoroughly handled. A modern civilisation will deem itself total as it finally does away with all inconveniences, vanquished the totality of the Unknowable, the Indifferent, the Unorganizeable, of Nature, by means of paving over it.</p>
<p>We have seen the non-participation to the throughput mechanisms of society labeled as escapism, but we look at it in reverse where one escapes by being apart from nature. An illusory sense of dominion and domestication of nature might make one think of it as a place where one can escape to, and this is re-enforced when seen through the lense of a synthetic protective layer of proxies and simulations, but the protective layer doesn't curve outward upon nature, but inward upon the individual. And that is absolute escapism.</p>
<p>We believe that one can use nature's indifference as a reminder of the actual fortitude of their being, to learn of one's own true capacity for resilience when communing with nature — Ideas altogether at odds with modern stories, or an invitation to be part of something.</p>

<h2 id="have-aligned-my-life-to-the-exploration-of-arts--science">have aligned my life to the exploration of <strong>Arts &amp; Science</strong>.</h2>
<p>The analysis of <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/horaire.html">personal statistics</a> recorded through years of <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/routine.html">daily journaling</a>, revealed that <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/travel.html">travel</a> converts into the most <em>hours of inspiration</em>. From this insight, I have oriented my creative work toward becoming a <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/nomad.html">nomad</a>.</p>
<p>Multi-tasking revealed itself to have a negative impact on my productivity. Working within the confines of a single medium, would convert into long periods of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place over a period of a year showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school, learning to play music, moving abroad — showed an improvement in the realization of <em>Arts &amp; Sciences</em>.</p>
<p>Learning to solve problems directly produced more sustained periods of output in comparison to searching for solutions which makes one dependant on the availability of material. Building specific <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/tools.html">tools</a> mostly returned higher performance than <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/about.html">learning general purpose tools</a>.</p>
<p>Optimizing toward the <strong>need for less revenue</strong> has yielded much better results than optimizing toward the generation of more.</p>
<p>Remaining immobile in moments of doubts and planning, always converted into better output, against acting impulsively and making possible accidental steps away from one's goals.</p>
<p>I have kept journals recording the oscillation of <strong>Efficiency</strong> and <strong>Effectiveness</strong>, and used this data to optimize and navigate my own personal tempers of productivity. Based on previously recorded patterns, I assign to myself each day a single task to complete. The task is chosen specifically to utilize the optimal amount of available stamina.</p>
<p>When a workday ends before the daily task is completed, the day was a planning failure; and the task is broken down into smaller tasks, each assigned to one day. When a task is completed too early, the day is also a planning failure.</p>
<p>I do not get out of bed until I have chosen a task to complete &amp; and a lesson to learn, and I do not go to sleep until I have logged the results. The tasks are selected in the following order: I first address the problems that slow me down, the things I find lacking in my life and the answers to questions that occupies my mind.</p>
