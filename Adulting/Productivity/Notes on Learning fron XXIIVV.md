### principles of learning
#webnotes

-   **Space learning over time**: Spaced schedules of studying and testing produce better long-term retention than a single study session or test.
-   **Worked example solutions problem solving exercises**: Presenting the students step-by-step solutions to problems should be intermixed with having the students solve the problems by themselves.
-   **Combine graphics with verbal descriptions**: Materials presented in verbal, visual and multimedia form are richer representations than those with a single modality or medium.
-   **Abstract and concrete representations of concepts**: An understanding of an abstract concept improves with multiple and varied concrete examples.
-   **Use quizzing to promote learning**: Testing enhances learning, particularly when the tests are aligned with important content.
-   **Help students allocate study time effectively**: Students need to allocate more time on difficult material and to have repeated practice for some concepts and skills. Outlining, integrating and synthesizing information produces better learning than re-reading materials or other more passive strategies.
-   **Ask deep explanatory questions**: Students benefit more from asking and answering deep questions that elicit explanations (e.g., why, why not, how, what if) than shallow questions (e.g., who, what, when, where).
-   **Contiguity**: Ideas that need to be associated should be presented contiguously in space and time.
-   **Perceptual-motor grounding**: Students learn better when teachers link concepts to concrete perceptual motor experiences, particularly at early stages of learning.
-   **Generation effect**: Learning is better when learners actively produce answers, rather than merely recognize answers as in multiple-choice questions.
-   **Stories and example cases**: Learners tend to remember stories and example cases better than didactic facts and abstract principles.
-   **Feedback**: Students benefit from feedback on their performance in a learning task, with the timing depending on the task. Learning incorrect information can be reduced when students are given immediate feedback.
-   **Manageable cognitive load**: Learning materials should not overload working memory.
-   **Cognitive disequilibrium**: Deep reasoning and learning is stimulated by problems that create cognitive disequilibrium, such as obstacles to goals, contradictions, conflict and anomalies.
-   **Cognitive flexibility**: Students’ cognitive flexibility improves when they are presented with multiple viewpoints that link facts, skills, procedures and deep conceptual principles.
-   **Goldilocks principle**: Assignments should not be too hard or too easy, but at the right level of difficulty for each student’s skill and prior knowledge.
-   **Anchored learning**: Learning is deeper and students are more motivated when the materials and skills are anchored in real-world problems that matter to the learner.
