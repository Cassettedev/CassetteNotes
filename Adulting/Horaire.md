Horaire is a time and productivity tracking method. A log is recorded at the end of the day, and contains 3 values

* Sector(sh), Audio, Visual, or Research.
* Concrete Hour(ch), a value of output. A 1 is something simple like writing documentation or planning, and a 9 is releasing a product or getting married.
* Focus Hour(fh), is a value of attention for the days task, where 1 indicates that little to no time was invested, and 9 indicates that most of the time was invested.
* General Productivity(ph), The final value that indicates how much time was spent.

The ph is calculated by dividing ch by fh. 
eg:
4ch / 7fh = 0.57ph
9ch / 3fh = 3.00ph

A graph is then made that combines all 3 sectors and their correspondent values. You can days this as a daily log, weekly log, or whatever you please. You could also make percentages out of this data, or do whatever else you wish.
