### Filipino Dynamite
For the recipe, use green chilis, cheese singles, spring roll wrapper (square ones) and whatever meat you have.

1.  Slice the chilis open and take out their seeds. You can cut off their stems, which makes it easier to seal when you're wrapping them with the spring roll wrapper, but you can also leave them on, like how they usually do it in the streets. This takes practice to effectively seal the wrapper tightly. :)
    
2.  Stuff them with sliced cheese singles and whatever meat I can find in the fridge, sometimes even leftovers. If I buy this outside (streetfood), they usually use sliced ham or ground pork. I like using sliced ham because it's easier but like I said, any meat will do. LOL I even used some leftover chicken nuggets at some point.
    
3.  Wrap them in spring roll wrapper. I prefer the square ones compared to the round ones but you can use either. Also, I love basil on everything so this is not typical but I sprinkle some dried basil on them before I wrap them up.
    
4.  Deep fry.
