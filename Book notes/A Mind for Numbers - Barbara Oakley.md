# A Mind for Numbers - Barbara Oakley
#booknotes
### Foreword:
* Henri Poincare struggled to figure out a mathematical problem for weeks. He figured it out when he took a vacation and let his mind rest.
* Your brain can work on a problem even if it is sleeping, as long as you think about it as you fall asleep.

### Preface:
* Repeated learning is a method of learning in which you simply read through notes or books over and over. This method of learning is not a good way to truly learn a subject. You simply become familiar with the text, but do not learn anything from it.

### Note to the reader:
* Professional scientists often figure out their own methods of learning and problem solving without sharing them to the general public. This books shares as much of this information as the author knows.

### Chapter 1:
* Many view themselves as being either "Good at math", or "Bad at math". The truth is that there are different "modes" for learning, and most do not tap into the one that makes them "Good at math".
* It is mostly the fault of the western education system. If you miss or blunder at any step of the learning process, you fall behind quickly. {page 2}
	>Mathematics - can be a saintly mother of a subject. It climbs logically and majestically from addition through subtraction, multiplication and division. Then it sweeps up towards the heavens of mathematical beauty. But math can also be a wicked step-mother. She is utterly unforgiving if you happen to miss any step of the logical sequence -- and missing a step is easy to do. - A Mind for Numbers - Barbara Oakley, {page 2}

	>I'd followed my inner passions without also being open to developing new ones - A Mind for Numbers - Barbara Oakley, {page 2}
* As Barbara progressed, she learned several things
	1. When and how to quit
	2. Don't take on too much at once
	3. Learn concepts and techniques related to solving problems
	4. Learn how to learn, learn how to learn the subject
{page 6}
* The brains purpose is to do calculations and work with data all the time, and it does it very efficiently. {page 6-7}
	>The Brain is designed to do extraordinary math calculations. - A Mind for Numbers - Barbara Oakley, {page 6-7}

#### Chapter 1: Summery
Chapter one serves as an intro to the author. She talks about her experience and trauma around math and scientific subjects., as well as and overview of how she came to learn math, and learn how the brain works. Learn how to learn. she then explains that she has talked to many scientists to compile as much knowledge as possible about this topic.

### Chapter 2:
* {page 9-10} A Chess player Magus Carlson took a few moments to walk away from a round of speed chess. This is an example of "diffuse" thinking in action.
* {page 10} Taking a bit to think and coming back to read this book is one of the core ideas of this book.
* {page 11} Mental pump. When reading a book, take a moment to glance over the chapter you are about to read. This makes several small "hooks" that let your brain grasp on to concepts and think about them in the background before you read them. You will end up having an easier time understanding the text.
* {page 11-12} Focused Mode Thinking is what is often associated with "problem solving", rationality, and analytical thinking. It is associated with the Pre-Frontal Cortex area of the brain.
* {page 12} Diffuse Mode Thinking is the process of relaxing and letting you mind wander. This mode allows you to make broad connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. This then allows us to see the "big picture" and think outside the box to solve problems.
* {page 13-16} A metaphor for the difference between these modes of thinking is a Pinball Machine with varying levels of tightly packed bumpers. Focused Mode Thinking would have all the bumpers being close together, causing the ball to spend a lot of time in one area, but not move to other areas very easily. Diffuse mode thinking, on the other hand, would have all the bumpers spread out across the whole machine, allowing the ball to move across the whole machine and bounce off many different bumpers, but not staying in one area for long. In this metaphor, the pinball machine is the brain, the bumpers are clusters of neurons, the ball is your train of thought. The act of going from Focused Mode to Diffuse Mode would be to allow some of the closely packed neurons to go down, allowing you to process the thought differently.
* {page 16} Math and science often require Focused Mode to be worked out, but they all take more effort than other modes of Focused thinking. This is because the brain is not evolved to understand the abstract mathematical concepts that we have invented.
* {page 17} The Einstellung Effect (pronounced Eye-nshtellung) is a phenomenon that occurs when you struggle to solve a problem due to already having a certain mindset towards solving a problem, but this mindset turns out to be the wrong mindset to have in order to solve a problem. Like trying to figure out an algebra problem using calculus.
* {page 17} It is easy to experience the Einstellung effect because people often skip textbooks and other theory before trying to solve a problem.
	>One significant mistake that students sometimes make in learning math and science is jumping into the water before they learn how to swim. - Barbara Oakley - A Mind for Numbers, page 17

* {page 18} Knowing how to obtain the true, correct solution that's actually relevant to the problem is one of the most valuable skills.
* {page 18} When you come across a new problem or new concept, you don't have the neural pathways required to solve it efficiently. You can make good use of diffuse thinking to try and draw from knowledge in other areas to come to a conclusion.
	>The harder you push your brain to come up with something creative, the less creative your ideas will be. - Shaun Wassell - A Mind for Numbers, page 19
