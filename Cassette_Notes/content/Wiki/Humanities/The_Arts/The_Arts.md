# The Arts are methods of communicating and expressing ideas
## [[Writing]]
Writing is the art of communicating ideas through the written word.

## Design
Design is the way something functions regarding its purpose. The design of a guitar is decided based on how good it is at being a guitar. Design as a craft differs from pure art in that design is focused on aiding the function of the subject. An elevator can be "ugly", but be beautifully designed in regards to its mechanical workings. There is a large overlap between design and art of course. Many artworks serve a function, requiring good design, and many designs rely on artistic beauty to better serve their function.
