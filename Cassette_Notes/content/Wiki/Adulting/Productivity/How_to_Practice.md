# What to keep in mind when going into a practice session
1. The day before, set a specific start time, and have a rough idea of how long you will practice for.
2. Determine *exactly* what you will practice. If you are going to practice "art", decide on something more specific. Are you going to practice anatomy? Which body part? Will you work on your colour theory? Figure this out beforehand, so you don't have to think about it when you sit down to practice.
3. Use the pomodoro method. Set a timer for 25Â mins (or some other long time) and do nothing but practice for that time. Once the 25 mins is over, set a timer for 5 mins and do something else for a while, like stretch or walk around. This lets your brain rests, and can aid in memorisation or problem-solving. After 3 sessions, take a break for 30 mins to an hour.

Other things to keep in mind:
- Get good sleep before and after the session (so always and forever) because sleep aids tremendously in learning.
- Try to make a separate work or practice environment for you to work in. This aids in getting into the mood for practice and not play.
- For every minute that you practice something, try to apply it practically. For drawing, this can be something like doing 45 mins of studying the arm anatomy, and then spending 45 mins drawing things that focus on arms. This aids in memorising what you have learned, and also aids in getting out of "tutorial hell".
- During the 5-min breaks, look at something far away for at least 20 seconds, a few times per break. This keeps the eyes strong and healthy.
- If listening to music, only listen to music with no lyrics.
