# Time tracker
## Android App version???
- made in kotlin
- has pomodoro timer with customisable timings
- automatically logs time
- tracks time over DS's
- has a focus on keeping the amount of tasks small and letting them build up over time. IE, reading 5 different books is still classed as the "reading" activity
- several ways to see how time is spent
- it must be very easy to track time
- It would be nice for data to be transferable to other things like my computer
- data should be stored in a safe way that I can access and move to another program in the case that I don't use it anymore.
- Graph view of time spent over several days, and time spent over one day
