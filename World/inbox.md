## Meta world size
The siz of the world will be contained to a single solar system. About 5-7 significant planets. One planet, the main one, will get the most attention. The other planets will not have life, and will be colonised by the main planet. 

## Timeline
The timeline of the world will span from early civilisation to a near-utopian space age, that then falls due to corruption and turns into an anarchist, solarpunk space world with limited space travel. There is a big focus on progression. The progression of science, culture, location, etc. 

## Magic system
The magic system is strongly based on the prinicples of electricity and computer science. "Enchanting" is the main focus, and basically functions like "programming" an object to make it do certain things or have certain traits. The progression of the magic system also follows the progression of electricty/computer science very closely. As it mimics technology in our world, it is used in a similar way. There is a magic internet, magic computers, magic replaces tech in our world, and electricty as we know it is discoverd, but not really used to it being inneficent. Magic can be learned by anyone. "Spells" are not really a thing, only enchanting. The average person alone cannot do any major damage with magic and enchanting, but a team of skilled magicians can create the nuclear bomb. Much like real life. "Electronic" music is discovered when someone uses magic to make instruments and other things maipulate and produce sound-waves in different ways. You cannot effectivly perform magic on a person due to the fact that a person naturally has the most advanced anti-magic system known at all. One can perform magic on themself, however, but this is extremly risky and likly results in death before anything significant. The tattoos and other cosmetics are magic???

## World Themes
The themes of the world mostly pertain to communism, anarchism, and other left wing philosophies. Themes of bodily automity, freedom, violence and power, identity and labels, and other such themes are sure to follow.

## Languages and con-langs
I plan to make at least one con-lang for the world to have. I want the world to have more than one language at least, and I don't want to treat english as the default language.

## Cultures and races
*note: "race" is a social construct determained by certain biological charictursitcs. Technically, in this world, there is only one "race". There are then differences in biological qualities that could be classified as different races.*
Fundementally, "humans" do not exist. The "race" has skin tones of black, as in obisidan, or white, as in marble, and shades of grey inbetween. They are often slim, 5'10 - 6'7 tall, black or white hair and all sahdes of grey, red, purple, or blue eyes. Everyone is generally very androgynous by our standards. Fingernails are either black or white, not grey. It is common to dye the fingers and tips of the hands black or white in a gradient as a fashion statement, similar to tattooing. The features of a person, skin colour, eye colour, hair colour, etc, is determianed not by genes, but by location relative to the stars and planets. People reproduce asexaully. 

## Racism?????
My stories unavoidably have themese of bigotry, class warfare, intersectionality, all sorts of leftist goodness. I am confident handling most things, but race isa tough one for me. How should I handle how different "races", different groups organised by biological differences, are treated and interacted with?

## Gods
While I don't want to *promote* religion and what-not, having gods for different cultures makes sense for the earlier time periods.

## Myths and Legends
In the late stage, there is a myth that a man figured out a way to travel faster than light. He used this tech/magic to travel far away and observe the world at an earlier stage.

## Magic and Art
as magic replaces tech, it is only natural that it replaces digital art, music, and cgi. Artworks and music are "programmed" onto screens or flat surfaces. This has themes of mixing art and science together instead of treating them as seperate. Some don't like using magic for art, as they thing it "has no soul" and "takes no skill".
