A unit rate and a rate are technically two different things.
A Rate is the ratio between two different units, while a Unit Rate is the ratio of two different units for a single thing.

For example, say a car travels 80km in 4 hours. Its rate would be 80km / 4 hours, but its unit rate would be 40km / hour. In this case, the hour is the "single thing". The car travels 40km for everyone hour (single thing).

Another example, a person runs 100 meters in 12.4 seconds. In 1 second, that person travels 8.06 meters. They travel 8.06 meters per second. In this case, a second is the "single thing"

To find the unit rate, you often divide the first number by the second number. **100 / 12.4 = 8.06**. This is done to make the first number equal to one, since we are comparing it to one of the second number, the unit.
