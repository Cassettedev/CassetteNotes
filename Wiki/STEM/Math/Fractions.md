# Adding fractions
To add fractions, you first have to look for if they have different denominators (the bottom number). 
If the denominators are different, you have to make them the same. One way you can do this is by finding the lowest common multiple of both numbers (the smallest whole number that both values can multiply to), and assigning that value to it. 
For example, **5/6 + 1/4** can become **10/12 + 3/12**. This is because you can multiply 6 by 2 to get 12, and 4 by 3 to get 12.
Once you have done this, you also have to change the numerator (the top number) to have the same ratio as the initial fraction. You can simply do this by multiplying the numerator by the same value that you used on the denominator. 
So you would do **5 x 2** to get 10/12 and **1 x 3** to get 3/12.
You can now do the addition as normal. **10/12  + 3/12 = 13/12**

# Subtracting fractions
To subtract fractions, you first have to look if they have different denominators.
If the denominators are different, you have to make them the same. One way you can do this is by finding the lowest common multiple of both numbers (the smallest whole number that both values can multiply to), and assigning that value to it. 
For example, **3/4 - 5/8** can become **3/8 - 5/8**. In this case, 8 is the lowest common denominator, so you only multiply 4 by 2. Once you have done this, you also have to multiply the numerator by the same value to have the same ratio. In this case, you can just do **3 x 2** to get **6/8 - 5/8**.
You can now do the subtraction as normal. **6/8 - 5/8 = 1/8** 

# Multiplying fractions
## Multiplying two fractions
To multiply fractions, you simply multiply the numerators together, and the denominators together.
For example, **5/6 x 2/3** can be thought of as **5x2/6x3** which is equal to **10/18**.
It is good practice to simplify the result. This can be done by dividing the numerator and denominator by a common factor.
In this case, both 10 and 18 are divisible by 2. So **10/18** becomes **5/9** because 2 is a common factor of both 10 and 18. You could simplify the two fractions before multiplying them to make things easier.

## Multiplying a whole number by a fraction
To multiply a whole number by a fraction, you turn the whole number into a fraction by putting it over 1. Multiplication is done as normal
For example, **6 x 1/3** becomes **6/1 x 1/3** which is equal to **6/3**.

## Multiplying a mixed number by a fraction
To multiply mixed numbers by fractions, you must convert the mixed number into an improper fraction. To do this, you multiply the whole number by the denominator, and then add that number onto the numerator, the denominator stays the same.
For example, **3 2/5 x 7/3** becomes **17/5 x 7/3** because **3 x 5 = 15** and then **15 + 2 = 17**, which becomes the new numerator. Multiplication is then done as normal. The answer will come out as an improper fraction.

# Dividing fractions
## Dividing two fractions
To divide two fractions, you turn the second fraction into its reciprocal, meaning you swap the numerator and denominator. You then multiply the fractions.
For example, **3/5 / 1/2** becomes **3/5 x 2/1** which is equal to **6/5**

## Dividing a fraction by a whole number
To divide a fraction by a whole number, you first turn the whole number into a fraction. You then turn that fraction into its reciprocal, and multiply the two fractions.
For example, **2/3 / 5** becomes **2/3 x 5/1** which becomes **2/3 x 1/5** which is equal to **2/15**

## Dividing a whole number by a fraction
To divide a whole number by a fraction, it is very similar to dividing a fraction by a whole number. You first turn the fraction into its reciprocal, and then turn the whole number into a fraction.
For example, **4 / 2/3** becomes **4/1 x 2/3** which becomes **4/1 x 3/2** which is equal to **12/2**.

## Dividing two mixed numbers
To divide two mixed numbers, you first convert them to improper fractions. After that, it is the same as dividing two normal fractions.
For example, **7 1/3 / 2 1/2** becomes **22/3 / 5/2** which then becomes **22/3 x 2/5** because you turn the second fraction into its reciprocal. The answer is **44/15**

###### Why is dividing the same as multiplying by the reciprocal?
They are the same because

## Converting a mixed number into an improper fraction
To convert a mixed number into an improper fraction, you multiply the whole number by the denominator, and then add that number onto the numerator, the denominator stays the same.
For example, **5 2/3** becomes **17/3** because you do **5 x 3** to get **15**, and then add that onto the numerator **2** to get **17**
