## Rule 1. The **=** signifies that the values on each side are the same.

## Rule 2. Any operation you do to one side of the equation, you do to the other.

## Rule 3. The opposite of addition is subtraction, and vice-versa. The opposite of multiplication is division, and vice-versa. The opposite of squaring and cubing is square-rooting and cube-rooting, and vice-versa.

To find a variable within an equation, you must rearrange the equation so that the variable is on one side of the equation, often the left side. You do this by:

You "undo" the equation that is being done on the variable that you want to solve, and you also do that to the other side, so the values remain equal.

**When multiplying a fraction (division), multiply by the denominator/s**

One of the tools that you have in manipulating equalities is the idea that you can modify both sides by the same amount. Intuitively:

If Alice and Bob have the same amount of money, and they each buy the same movie ticket, they still have the same amount of money, even though their current amount is not what they originally have had.

In algebraic terms:

If A = B at start, then A - m = B - m (no matter what m is).

Now let's give Alice and Bob a more complicated amount of money, which will be:

Alice gets "6x+3y". Bob gets "12". These happen to be the same amount, just with complicated expressions, but

6x + 3y = 12

If we now have them each buy a movie ticket, **no matter what the ticket costs**, they will still have the same amount.

Let's have the movie ticket be worth "6x".

Alice now has "6x+3y" - "6x" remaining. Bob has "12" - "6x"remaining. These are the same amount. Summarizing:

6x + 3y = 12

(6x + 3y) - (6x) = (12) - (6x)

3y = 12 - 6x

Because the 6x - 6x poofs away on Alice's side.

**In other words, the 6x does not travel. Rather, the -6x on the right is an artifact remaining after you subtract 6x from both sides of the equation.**

So why would you do this?

We made a whole bunch of choices. We chose the movie ticket to be "6x" for example. We did not have to do this. We could have chosen some other value, or expression. However, by choosing "6x" we ended up with a result that has the "y" part of the expression isolated on one side from everything else:

3y = 12 - 6x

Is this convenient? It might be. It is if you are trying to solve for y, that is to end up with something that looks like "y=(STUFF WITHOUT y)" Ultimately it is up to the solver to look at an equations like

6x + 3y = 12

And decide how they want to manipulate it to get something meaningful. For a substitution method system solve, aiming to transform into "y=(STUFF WITHOUT y)" or "x=(STUFF WITHOUT x)" is the goal. For other methods, there are other goals.

Ultimately the goal is to transform your way of thinking from "I will follow the steps" to "I have these tools and this is my goal". This allows us to accomplish a lot more involved tasks, such as solving equation systems.

You can do this. Be a person with a toolbox and a goal, and know power.

Ask yourself: _what operations are being done to V?_

Then do the opposite of those operations.

For example:

a = bV / c

What is being done to V? It is being multiplied by b. Do the opposite: divide by b.

a**/b** = (bV / c) **/b**

This cancels the effect of the b on the right hand side, leaving you with:

a/b = V / c

What is being done to V? It is being divided by c. Do the opposite: multiply by c.

(a/b) * **c** = (V / c) * **c**

This cancels the effect of the c on the right hand side, leaving you with:

ac/b = V

The equation is now solved for V.
