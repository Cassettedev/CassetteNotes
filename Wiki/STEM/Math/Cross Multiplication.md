When we have a situation like **8/12 = 3/2**, we can use cross multiplication to come to **8x3 = 12x2**.

Why does this work? Multiplying the top and bottom of a fraction by the same amount does not change its value. 

You multiply the top and bottom section of the fraction by the other fractions' denominator. So we get **8x3/12x3 = 2x12/3x12**. The two denominators now have the same value, so they might as well be removed. "Something" over **12x3** *must* also equal "something" over **12x3**.
