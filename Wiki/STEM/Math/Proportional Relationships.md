A Proportional Relationship is a relationship between two values where their ratios are equivalent. One variable is always a constant variable times the other.

| Num of Eggs | Num of Milk cups | Ratio |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----- | 
| 1 | 2 | 1 : 2 |
| 3 | 6 | 3 : 6 |
| 12 | 24 | 12 : 24 |
In this example, the ratio is always **x * y **. **3 * 2 = 6 **. Etc

## Constant of Proportionality 
The Constant of Proportionality refers to the constant variable of the ratio between the two numbers. In the above example, the constant would be 2. The constant is often represented as **k**.

The equation to figure out **k** when you have two numbers is **y / x**.
If **y = 6** and **x = 3** then we could do **6 / 3** and conclude that **k = 2** because **6 / 3 = 2**.

It is important to note that in this case, *Num of Milk cups* represents **y** while *Num of Eggs* represents **x**. **x** is always the first number in the ratio, followed by **y**.

**The Ratio is y / x NOT x /** 

### Finding y
If you have **x** and **k** and want to figure out **y**, you can do **x * k**. Continuing with the same example, **y = 3 * 2** which equals **6**.  

### Finding x
If you have **y** and **k** and want to figure out **x**, you can do **y / k**. Continuing with the same example, **x = 6 / 2** which equals **3**.

### Khan Academy method
If you have a situation like **6y = 3x** and you need to find **k**, you can divide both **y** and **x** by the value of **y**. So **6y/6 = 3x/6** which equals **y = 1/2x** which makes **k** equal **1/2**.
