A Proportional Relationship is a relationship between two values where their ratios are equivalent. One variable is always a constant variable times the other.

| Num of Eggs | Num of Milk cups | Ratio | Constant |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----- | -------- |
| 1 | 2 | 1 : 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 6 | 3 : 6 | 2 |
| 12 | 24 | 12 : 24 | 2 |
In this example, the ratio is always *x * y*. So for example; *3 * 2 = 6*. Etc

## Constant of Proportionality 
The Constant of Proportionality refers to the constant variable of the ratio between the two numbers. In the above example, the constant would be 2. The constant is often represented as **k**.

In a situation where you paid $4.25 for seventeen apples, and you want to know how much you paid for each apple, the constant, you could just do **total cost / number of apples**. So **4.25 / 17** which equals 0.25.

### Khan Academy method
A common question in Khan Academy will look like **d = 2c**.

If you have a situation like **6y = 3x** and you need to find **k**, you can divide both **y** and **x** by the value of **y**. So **6y/6 = 3x/6** which equals **y = 1/2x** which makes **k** equal **1/2**.

### How to find the dependent and independent variable.
**The dependent variable is the output and the independent is the input, the thing that affects the output.**
**y is always the dependent variable.**

### Solve for x
To find **x**, you divide **y** by **k**
