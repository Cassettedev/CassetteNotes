* How to write an essay

** Structure
 Essays can come in many structures, but the easiest and most common form is the classic 3-body essay you learn in highschool. the 3-body structure features:
 - introduction
 - first body paragraph
 - second body paragraph
 - third body paragraph
 - conclusion

 The introduction introduces the topic and your argumetns on a basic level. The body paragrphs each cover one argument related to the topic. The conclusion restates the topic and concludes what arguments have been made.

 The body paragraph should be formatted in a similar way to the essay as a whole. You introduce the argument and how it relates to the topic, 

 The 3-body essay is fine, and you can add/remove paragraphs according to how many arguments you have. But its simplicity can be its downfall.
