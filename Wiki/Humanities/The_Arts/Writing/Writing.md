# Notes on writing from XXIIVV
### writing knowledge
-   Never use a long word where a short one will do.
-   If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
-   Never use the passive where you can use the active.
-   Never use a foreign or scientific word, if you can think of an English equivalent.
-   Never use a figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
-   Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
