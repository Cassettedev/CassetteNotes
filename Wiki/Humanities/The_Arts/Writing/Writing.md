**[[Writing]]**
# Writing is the art of communicating and expressing ideas through the written word
Utilising the written form of language, you can easily allow your ideas to be shared and understood by other people without relying on the spoken word. While extremely powerful, the caveat is that the person attempting to read your writing has to understand what you have written.

### writing knowledge
-   Never use a long word where a short one will do.
-   If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
-   Never use the passive where you can use the active.
-   Never use a foreign or scientific word, if you can think of an English equivalent.
-   Never use a figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
-   Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
