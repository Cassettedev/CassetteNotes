Language exists at two levels. The level of the Form, and the level of the Combination of Forms

## Forms
The sounds or shapes used, which don't have inherent meaning

## Combinaiton of Forms
The synthesis of forms used to create meaning

## Sign
A Sign is anything that conveys meaning beyond itself. "rain" and the smell of moisture in the air can both be signs of rain. A sign can also refer to the literal hand-sign used in signed language

## Arbitrariness of the Sign
Refering to the fact that a Sign has no inherent reason to be the thing it is. A person could've pointed at a rock and said "rain" and it would've been just as valid.

## Reflexivity
The ability to use language to talk about language
