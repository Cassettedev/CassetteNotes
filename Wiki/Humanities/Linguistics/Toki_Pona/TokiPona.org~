## Grammar

- use "li" to seperate a 3rd person from its verb, an actor from its action.
"I eat" is "mi moku", but "they eat" is "ona li moku"
- verbs often come after pronouns
- use "la" to inditcate that the words before it seve as context for the words after it
- use "e" to introduce an object to a verb. (noun) e (verb) implies that the noun is being verbed
"ona li moku e kala" is "they (li) eat (e) fish"
- "li" is placed after subjects aside from "mi" and "sina"
- you don't need to specify plural, but you can with "mute"
"Jan li kama" means "person/people is/are coming", but "Jan mute li kama" means "many people are coming" specificaly
- there are no verb tenses. You can add a time phrase to be specific.
"Jan li pali" means "a person is working" "worked" and "will work" all at the same time.
- you can say "subject wants to verb" you can use "wile"
"mi wile sitelen" means "I want to draw" or "I will draw"

## Sentence Structure Examples

Basic structure:
- [noun] li [noun / adjective]
in english this would be
- [noun] is (a) [noun]
or
- [noun] is [adjective]
for example:
"ona li suli" - "they are big/great/important"
"kili li pona" - "fruit/vegetable(s) is/are good"
If the subject is "mi" or "sina", it is not necessary to add the word "li". So:
"sina li suli" can become "sina suli" to mean "you are important"
This can also be thought of as:
SUBJECT li VERB li VERB li VERB etc etc etc
You can also do this with "e":
SUBJECT li VERB e OBJECT e OBJECT e OBJECT etc etc etc

The structure of this sentence is:
"Mi late mute la, mi pilin pona" - "When I sleep a lot, I feel good"
SUBJECT, VERB, COMPLIMENT, CONTEXT, SUBJECT, VERB, COMPLIMENT
"la" would be "when" in this case, but notice it comes at the end of the time clause rather than at the beginning

from the discord:
```transitives in toki pona are:
-to cause to be X (mi pona e ni = i cause ni to be pona)
-to make into X (mi jan e ilo = i cause the ilo to be a jan)
-to apply X to smth (mi luka e ni = i apply (my) luka to this)

all words can perform all these functions as transitives```
