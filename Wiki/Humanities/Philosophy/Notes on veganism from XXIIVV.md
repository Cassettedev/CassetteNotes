### Animal Rights
#webnotes

-   **Animal Liberation Front**: An international, leaderless resistance that engages in removing animals from laboratories and farms, destroying facilities, arranging safe houses and veterinary care, and operating sanctuaries where the animals subsequently live.
-   **Animal Advocacy**: Promotion of the interests of animals, generally. Includes work for animal rights and animal welfare.
-   **Commodification**: The conversion of a living being, principle, or natural environment into an "object" that is used, exchanged, or consumed for profit or other desired gain.
-   **Debarking**: The surgical removal and manipulation of tissue in a dog's vocal cords to drastically quiet his or her natural bark. Debarking does not address the underlying reasons that a dog may be barking excessively, and the dog will continue to bark, albeit more quietly or silently.
-   **Draize Test**: Infamous and excruciating eye-irritation test for household products and cosmetics in which drops of a substance are placed in the eyes of rabbits, causing the animals ulcers, blindness, and other injuries before they are ultimately killed.
-   **Flowerpot Technique**: A technique used in sleep deprivation studies designed to allow NREM sleep but prevent REM sleep.
-   **Forced Molting**: The egg-industry practice of artificially inducing hens to molt by depriving them of food for several days to two weeks when their egg production has declined.
-   **Rape Rack**: The industry term referring to the contraptions in which cows and pigs are restrained while they are forcibly inseminated.
-   **Veal Crate**: Small crate in which a calf being raised for veal is confined and tied up. The calf's movement within the crate is intentionally restricted to limit the strengthening of muscle, and an insufficient diet is provided intentionally to keep the cow anemic.

When advocating lifestyles that abandon maximalism, it is important to frame it in a positive way. Settling for simple and coarse things does not need to be a "sacrifice" but something genuinely better than the mainstream alternative.
