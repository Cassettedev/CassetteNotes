# Notes on adaptation from XXIIVV
## Capitalism Fascism Reactionism Fuck Off!
## We will face this reality honestly and learn how to live with it.
We realize that the current and upcoming crises cannot be reduced to a set of problems in need of technological or political solutions. We believe that the roots of the current and upcoming crises lie in the stories we have been telling ourselves.

Collapse won't be addressed by buying a Prius, signing a treaty, or turning off the air-conditioning. The biggest problem we face is a philosophical one: understanding that this civilization is already dead. The sooner we confront this problem, and the sooner we realize there’s nothing we can do to save ourselves, the sooner we can get down to the hard work of adapting, with mortal humility, to our new reality.

The **myth of progress** tells us that we are destined for greatness, that we began grunting in the primeval swamps, as a humble part of something called _nature_, which we have now triumphantly subdued.

It came to be understood among the people of our culture that life in _the wild_ was governed by a single, cruel law known as "kill or be killed." In recent decades, ethologists have discovered that this law is a fiction. In fact, a system of laws, universally observed, preserves the tranquility of the wild, protects species and even individuals, and promotes the well-being of the community as a whole. This system of laws has been called, among other things, the peacekeeping law, the law of limited competition, and _animal ethics_.

### regenerative sustainability

-   **Integrity**: Maintaining the wholeness of wider systems, ensuring that structure and relationships remain intact and functioning as they should.
-   **Inclusivity**: Interacting with the world in its entirety, engaging and integrating with all dimensions, levels of existence and knowledge.
-   **Harmony**: All elements cooperate through relationships that are respectful in order to avoid dissonance.
-   **Respect**: All parts of the world have intrinsic worth and all existence is part of the extended self, and therefore all self-respect is extended to mutual respect for the world.
-   **Mutuality**: Compassion, treating others the same as yourself.
-   **Positive reciprocity**: Reciprocating in a way that is of benefit to and advances the relationship between self and extended self.
-   **Fellowship**: An extension of mutuality and positive reciprocity, where the world is co-created by humans in partnership with nature.
-   **Responsibility**: Morally accountability for the consequences of our actions in an uncertain and unpredictable world.
-   **Humility**: Change is constant, we cannot know the true consequences of our actions.
-   **Non-attachment**: In order to adapt to changing circumstances it is important to uphold non-attachment in order to decouple from the futility of trying to hold onto anything in an ever changing world including ideas, dogmas and strategies.

When advocating lifestyles that abandon maximalism, it is important to frame it in a positive way. Settling for simple and coarse things does not need to be a "sacrifice" but something genuinely better than the mainstream alternative.

# Notes on Anarchy from XXIIVV
## Anarchy means not necessarily the absence of order but an absence of rule.
Anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems of control including but not limited to the state, capitalism, racism, sexism, ableism, speciesism, and religion.

Anarchists wish to create a society based upon individual freedom and voluntary cooperation. Anarchism is founded on the observation that since only a few are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.

Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.

To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same. Anarchists fight for a society which respects individuals and their freedom, and believe in peace at any price — except at the price of liberty.

Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a person.

>The individual cannot bargain with the State. The State recognizes no coinage but power: and it issues the coins itself.

-Ursula K. Le Guin, The Dispossessed

### green anarchism

-   **Anarchy**: A word that comes from the Greek, and signifying "without government", the state of a people without any constituted authority.
-   **Health**: A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
-   **Dark Greens**: The ones who believe that environmental problems are an inherent part of industrialized civilization, and seek radical political change.
-   **Light Greens**: The ones who see protecting the environment first and foremost as a personal responsibility, focusing on environmentalism as a lifestyle choice.
-   **Veganism**: A philosophy and way of living which seeks to prevent all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, other animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.
-   **Ecofeminism**: Ecofeminist thinkers draw on the concept of gender to theorize on the relationship between humans and the natural world.

>If the penalty for a crime is a fine, then that law only exists for the lower class

>Violence is the base governing system for debt.

A just society would be one in which liberty for one person is constrained only by the demands created by equal liberty for another.

# Notes on Luddism from XXIIVV
## Sabotage means primarily: the withdrawal of efficiency
Luddism was a working-class movement opposed to the political consequences of industrial capitalism. The Luddites wanted technology to be deployed in ways that made work more humane and gave workers more autonomy. The bosses, on the other hand, wanted to drive down costs and increase productivity. Smashing looms and stocking frames was the tactic, not their goal. Their goal was to challenge not the technology itself, but rather the social relations that governed its use.

A neo-Luddite movement would understand no technology is sacred in itself, but is only worthwhile insofar as it benefits society. It would confront the harms done by digital capitalism and seek to address them by giving people more power over the technological systems that structure their lives.

# Notes on Solarpunk from XXIIVV
## Sustainability, longevity, and balance with an emphasis on renewable energy.
Solarpunk is movement centered on using and being affected by the use of renewable resources with a focus on decentralisation, community activism, social justice and civic empowerment. A recognition that economic, social, and ecological injustices are all deeply inter-connected.

Embracing approachable, personal technology and envisioning a world in which the detritus of consumer culture is appropriated and repurposed toward the reconstruction of a devastated ecology.

Permaculture is the science and practice of creating semi-permanent ecosystems of nature. The resilience of any such ecosystem is equal to it's diversity + interconnectedness. Permaculture design is a system of assembling conceptual, material and strategic components in a pattern which functions to benefit life in all its forms. It seeks to provide a sustainable and secure place for living things on this earth.

Punk is a rejection of mainstream, corporate mass culture and its values. It manifests through direct action, such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, ecotage, street barricades, squatting, pirate radio, off-grid energy, graffiti, vandalism and public and business property destruction.

>The end of the human race will be that it will eventually die of civilisation.

-Ralph Waldo Emerson

Solarpunk is also a reaction to the cynical and dystopian imaginaries that have come out of the fear of climate change. It is a way of tackling ecoanxieties and an invitation to complement the important work of climate scientists. Just as climate scientists have sought to warn the world about the dangers of climate change, Solarpunks are offering alternative visions to the helplessness often generated by such warnings.

We're destroying the world because we are, in a very literal and deliberate way, at war with it. People need more than to be made to feel stupid and guilty. They need more than a vision of doom. They need a vision of the world and of themselves that **inspires them**.

# Notes on The Marvelous Pursuit from XXIIVV
## The marvelous pursuit is an attempt to find paths out of alienation, by refusing to conceive of human action as divisible into the physical and the mental.
The marvelous pursuit is born from the desire to create playful complexity in a desert of simplistic convenience. A hobby is a form of consumption, the marvelous pursuit on the other hand, is a rejection of commodified convenience, it can't be bought because it has no price. A marvelous pursuit refuses socially ascribed use. People learn such socially useless things as the names of fern and the grammar of dead languages because they are bored with the mind-dumbing options dished out to them on TV.

Marvelous pursuits are a means to resist alienation from one's environment because they are a temporary means to make that environment one's own, by ascribing one's own, often bizarre, value for things and spaces. The marvelous pursuit often creates complexity but a complexity which is opposed to that of the technician. The _master_ of a marvelous pursuit can never be an engineer because the marvelous is by nature useless to society (and therefore to capital).

>I suppose if people thought about real issues and needs instead of manufactured desires, the economy would collapse and we'd have total anarchy

Hobbies are forms of alienated leisure, compartmentalized parts of one's life, past-times whose purpose is to fill our time with countable accomplishments and enjoyments. The value in marvelous pursuits lies in their self-creation which evades both use-value and exchange value.

People need not only to obtain things, they need above all the freedom to make things among which they can live, to give shape to them according to their own tastes, and to put them to use in caring for and about others.

# Notes on wisdom from XXIIVV

## A collection of notes on Wisdom.
The end of the cycle is that of the independent, clear-minded, all-seeing Child. That is the level known as **wisdom**.

To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of **simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust**.

>There are two wisdoms: the first inclines to action, the second to inaction.

-Stanislaw Lem, Cyberiada

### five rings

-   Think of what is right and true.
-   Practice and cultivate the sciences.
-   Become acquainted with the arts.
-   Know the principles of the crafts.
-   Understand the harm and benefit in every thing.
-   Work to see every thing clearly.
-   Pay attention to subtleties.
-   Be careful even in small matters.
-   Don't do anything useless.

### Gurdjieff's self-remembering

Put simply, one is to remember themselves as much as possible. A portion of your conscious action should be of being conscious of being conscious of being. Self-remembering and being-present are not the same, though abstractly they serve the same purpose. When one becomes overly emotional, overly attached, or identified with some idea of brand to the extent of a personal automatism, they have lost their self - they have forgotten themselves.

When the Hyperpresent begins to attend to your reality, begins to barrage you with the minute and incessant comings-and-goings of modernity, do not let your self be pulled by that which you never asked for in the first place. Remember to self-remember. Remember yourself, focus on being. Whether or not there is an emotion, a thought, a presence, an analysis, there is still something observing, and that which is observing you should turn your attention towards.

## A collection of notes in regard to Action.

**Ahimsa**, or _Cause no injury, do no harm_, is a Buddhist concept referred to as nonviolence, and it applies to all living beings — including all animals.

### action wisdom

-   Control of actions and speech to avoid unwholesome actions.
-   Effort to work as much as possible for the good of others, even at the risk of one's life.
-   Decision to devote oneself to beneficial actions and to remain steadfast on it.
-   Maintaining a state of mind turned to the happiness of others, to practise love for all beings without exception.
-   Development of knowledge and understanding through study and analytical reflection. To teach knowledge to others. To use one's wisdom for a maximum of benefits.
-   You may compete to the full extent of your capabilities, but you may not hunt down your competitors.
-   The creatures who act as though they belong to the world follow the peace-keeping law, they give the creatures around them a chance to grow toward watever it's possible for them to become. That's how man came into being, the australopithecus didn't imagine that the world belonged to them, so they let him live and grow.
-   You must absolutely and forever relinquish the idea that you know who should live and who should die on this planet.

## A collection of notes in regard to Inaction.

**Wu Wei** means without doing, causing, or making. It flows like water, reflects like a mirror, and responds like an echo.

### inaction wisdom

-   Establishment of an always perfect tolerance, irrespective of the actions and words of others towards oneself.
-   Truthfulness (to say only what is right).
-   Rejection of hatred and worship. Not to follow any particular idea. Maintaining the mind in equanimity.

What is joy? Joy is the feeling of passing from a lesser to a greater perfection. Joy is the feeling that we are advancing towards happiness. What is happiness? Happiness is the state of the soul that feels itself free of all outside servitudes and feels itself in perfect accord with itself.
