** Major and Minor Modes
 Major Modes are modes that are applied to a buffer in order to give that buffer certain functionality. This can be things like ORG Mode, Emacs Lisp Mode, etc etc. It is very comparable to how certain files like Markdown files get certain functionality. There can only be one Major Mode active in one buffer at a time.

 Minor Modes provide functionality that isn't tied to a specific file or mode of the current buffer. Many Minor Modes can be active at once. A good example is ~hl-line-mode~ and ~global-hl-line-mode~.

** init.el
 The ~init.el~ file is the config file for emacs.

** Org Mode
 Org Mode is a Markdown-like mode for emacs that allows you to do many things such as keep track of tasks.
 - TAB and S-TAB :: Fold and Unfold
 - M-up :: Move a heading up
 - M-down :: Move a heading down
 - M-left :: Promote a heading
 - M-right :: Demote a heading
