# Input
## All creative pursuits must start with input:
- Movies
- Shows
- Significant musical experiences (concerts, finding a new genre)
- Museums
- Travelling/moving
- Meeting significant people
- Other significant events

# Process
## All processes must be something that could lead to or influence output:
- Programming
- Maths
- Art (drawing and painting)
- Writing
- Music

# Output
## All output must be a product of an above process, or a result of a significant lifestyle change/event:
- Games
- Movies
- Artwork
- Songs
- Programs
- Tools
- Books
- Moving somewhere new

The difference between lifestyle changes in INPUT and OUTPUT is that the INPUT changes are changes that are out of your control, while OUTPUT changes are changes that you cause. All INPUT "happens to you" while all OUTPUT is things you caused to happen. Moving onto a sailboat would be OUPUT because you chose to do that, while being forced to move out would be INPUT because it is something that happend to you.
