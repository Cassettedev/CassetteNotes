# Goals
While I try not to live in the future to often, It is important to have something to be pushing towards. All of these goals do not have deadlines and do not have a stage of completion. They are things I can constantly improve and push towards.

##### Get into astronomy

##### Learn a language or twenty
I don't necessarily want to be conversationally fluent in any of these languages, rather, I want to read books and poetry, listen to songs, and watch movies in their native languages so I can have a better understanding of them.

Some languages might be;
* Russian
* Arabic
* French
* German
* Latin
* Italian

##### Become a competent in [The_Arts](wiki/humanities/../../../Wiki/Humanities/The_Arts/The_Arts.md)
To be component in The Arts is to have a level of mastery that allows me to create anything I want with little to no hesitation, confident that I will have the skills to create it, if not learn how to create it extremely quickly.

##### Become competent at many [STEM](wiki/stem/../../../Wiki/STEM/STEM.md) subjects
I seek to become a gay that can do math, making me the most powerful gay of them all.

A common theme through all these more "practical skills" in compared to the arts is the concept of making tools for myself. I want to make my own software that's bespoke to me. My own drawing software, my own music software, my own programming language, my own virtual machine. I want to make physical things that help me. Furniture, tools, my own instruments, my own paint even.

I don't want to just slap javascript libraries together and make an LED blink with an Arduino, I want to understand and use these tools on a deeper level. I'm very interested in low level programming with things like C and Assembly language, as well as graphical programming. In terms of hardware, breadboard computers really catch my eye. 

##### Specific skills I like
- Drawing
- Painting
- Writing, poetry, blog posts, novels, screen, essays, etc
- Math
- Music, music theory, guitar, piano, synths and sound design
- Programming, games, Hundred Rabbits type beat
- Sewing, making own clothes
- Cooking
- Languages, french, german, russian, arabic, latin, tonki pona 
- Handwriting, calligraphy and normal handwriting

#### Become self-employed
We are tied to the schedules of other people, the work of other people, and the lives of other people. We get up at times we don't want to (or shouldn't). We do work we don't want to, work we hate, and work that actively makes the world a worse place. Then, after all that, we talk to other people about work. "What do you do for a living?". Some people seem to be fine with this. I am not.

It's not that I don't want to work, nor do I think no one should. I want to work on my own time, work on projects that I actually enjoy, work on things that will actually make the world a better place. I want to wake up and go to bed on my own time, I want to work only for as long as I need, about 4 hours for the average person. I believe that working like this will be a massive boost to my mental health and wellbeing.

#### Create an artist collective
I am jealous of the artists from the past. They were always surrounded by other artists. The artists from the Renaissance were always found in groups in their studios or workshops. They didn't just do art, but science and philosophy as well, it being the Renaissance of course. Having a mentor-student relationship wasn't just common, it was near the only way to become an artist of any sort. In 18th century France, women of the higher class would come together and organise what were essentially art clubs. They would talk about books, the arts, as well as science and philosophy. This continued until the 20th century. People like Picasso and Hemingway belonged to groups like these, even if only for a short time.

Thinking about having a group like this fills me with a joy that no written language can describe. You would have to see my face light up with joy and hear the words rush out of my mouth for you to even start to understand how much I want this in my life.

I know there are people around the world like this, I meet them all the time online. But as cool as the internet is for connecting people, it doesn't give me what I want. Internet friendships are amazing, and I'm grateful for all the ones I have, but they just don't compare to the experience of physical friendships in my opinion. There's a good reason people who are good friends online end up making an effort to see each other in person. I believe it's actually the internet itself that killed these kinds of artists groups, but I'm not going to go into that here.

This, out of all of my goals, is both the hardest and the one I want the most. The age of the loner artist who hates people and never goes outside is over.
